I don't know\nYou can meet me up at the pent'\nKnock 'em out the box with a chocolate kiss\nHope I ain't sayin' too much\nI like 'em dangerous\n\nLookin' for the dangerous type (Type, type, type)\nI like 'em dangerous\nI'm lookin' for the dangerous type\nI said I like 'em dangerous\n\nDangerous\nDangerous\n\nFresh outta Sing Sing, nah, I'm just playin'\nThat was just a castle and an evil king\nMade my escape, yes, I had to flee\nNow it's sex in the city and a couple little flings\nMotorcycle man had a yen for me\nLiked to rush through the tunnel at a breakneck speed\nComputer boy toy, he was fun for a while\n'Til I caught him on the web hacking other girls' files\nYou know the guy say he worked construction\nTurns out he was movin' them pounds through customs\nThey wanna settle down but I just don't trust 'em\nThey wanna lock me down, but there's no handcuffin'\nSaid we'd be together, but you didn't stay forever\nNow I guess it's just whatever 'til the twelfth of never\nI've never been afraid of love\nThat's why I like 'em dangerous\n\nI'm lookin' for the dangerous type (Lookin' for that danger)\nI like 'em dangerous (I like 'em dangerous)\nThat's my type\nI'm lookin' for the dangerous type\nI said I like 'em dangerous\n\nOh, yes, I want someone to step to me\nOh, yes, I want someone to rescue me\nOh, yes, l've never been afraid of love\nOh, yes, that's why I like 'em dangerous (I like 'em dangerous)\nOh, yes, I want someone to step to me\nOh, yes, I want someone to rescue me\nOh, yes, l've never been afraid of love (Dangerous)\nOh, yes, that's why I like 'em dangerous\n\nI said I like 'em dangerous"}
