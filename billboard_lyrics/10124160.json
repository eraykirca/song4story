For a cruel fraternity\nI pledged and I still mean it\nOld habits die screaming\n\nSix weeks of breathin' clean air\nI still miss the smoke\nWere you makin' fun of me\nWith some esoteric joke?\nNow I wanna sell my house\nAnd set fire to all my clothes\nAnd hire a priest to come and exorcise my demons\nEven if I die screaming\nAnd I hope you hear it\nAnd I hope it's shitty in The Black Dog\nWhen someone plays \"The Starting Line\"\nAnd you jump up, but she's too young to know this song\nThat was intertwined in the tragic fabric of our dreaming\n'Cause tail between your legs, you're leavin'\n\nI still can't believe it\n'Cause old habits die screaming"}
