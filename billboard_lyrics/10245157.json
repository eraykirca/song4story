If you really handled your business, then you wouldn't have so much interest in mines\nBreakin' news, I've officially entered my prime\nWhich is real interesting, this is the point where a rapper would typically start to decline\nSomehow I climbed\nRight when you thought I was fine, we're runnin' a little behind\nNipsey was tryin' to tell you this a marathon\nOnly listen to Minister Farrakhan\nOh my God, it just hit me, it's terrifyin'\nI'm a star like the shit on the sheriff sign\nIf time was really money, I could purchase like two thousand bricks with my spare time\nAll praises due to my God\nDark days is too far behind\nI part ways with the struggle, my hustle gon' always keep the squad paid\nAll labor, no off days 'cause the money don't sleep\nAnd due to the focus, I couldn't even go broke if I spend like five hundred a week\nAnd talk is cheap, I got a short receipt, can tell by your heart, you're weak\nOne thing 'bout this money, it's easy to get it, but trust me, my nigga, it's hard to keep\n\nYeah, he climbed out the great Ville, that's gangster\nHe missed meals to make mills, that's gangster\nThen came back and gave back, that's gangster\nSame chick from way back, he's gangster\n\nReach for my dog 'fore his shit get dicey\nShinin' now, you never seen a clique get icy\nWatchin' my step, tryna look just like me\nNigga, you can try, but this shit get pricey\nNigga, you can try, but this shit get pricey\nNigga, you can try, but this shit get pricey\nNigga, you can try, but this shit get pricey\nNigga, you can try\nThe trials and tribulations of creation\nIt's a quiet theme of those in dire need of elevation\nOne minute, infatuation\nNext minute, hatin' every statement you makin'\nConstant contemplation\nYearnin' for hooks uncanny, search every nook and cranny for inspiration\nStep outside for better ventilation\nSmoke somethin', hope somethin' comes from the stimulation\nThrough it all, stay patient\nGet in tune with God\nFor when lightnin' strikes, it's He who decides\nWe from a crueler side where the youth get euthanized\nSmall fries get suicide for movin' pies\nAll while blind eyes get turned from suit and ties\nThe truth, it lies somewhere in the middle\nOf half-ass rappers and cap-ass crackers on Capital Hill\nAin't no protection for hearts that get spilled\nWhen sharin' with this world with art can get killed\nUse your discretion\nTo believe or not to believe? That is the question\nMight Delete Later"}
