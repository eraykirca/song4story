Uh\nI wanna lock it in, baby, no weighin' my options\nWanna travel, see the world, gettin' drunk on an island\nWanna settle, start a family, so tell me about it\nAnd you so perfect, baby, don't give nobody that body (Okay)\nSocial anxiety, I fear\nAnd I done been this way for some years\nI don't really get along with my peers\nEverything that they do to me is weird\nSo in a world full of weirdos, fools, and scrubs\nTell me, what is it you're willin' to do for love?\nYou know it's true that the datin' pool is fucked\nAin't nobody out here, baby, it just be us\nAnd I know, and I know, and I know, and I know a broken heart when I see one\nAnd I feel, and I feel, and I feel, and I feel like I love you more\nDid you know? Do you know? Did you know? Do you know I'm a shoulder if you need one?\nWhen I feel what I feel, keep it real, what\u2019s the deal? I'm ready for\nGo somewhere we could be alone, you and me alone\nI remember bein' twenty-one when my life had just begun\nTwenty-two, many things to see and do\nTwenty-three, lookin' forward to twenty-four\nIs it just me or it ain't no love no more?\nTwenty-five, what a time to be alive\nAm I getting old? Why do I feel tired?\nAll the same old things, the same old games\nSame old pain, think it's time for a change 'cause\nCertain shit ain't like me no more\nCertain shit don't excite me no more\nIt don't excite me no more, no\nIt ain't like me no more\nNo more, no more\nNo, no, no, no, no\nCertain shit don't excite me no more\nIt ain't like me no more\nThis ain't like me no more, no\nIt don't excite me no more, uh\n\nUh"}
