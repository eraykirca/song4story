Ah\nTo tell the truth, it fucked me up when D-Man passed\nThe motive was the condolences, but the pride crashed\nI had to bypass old mythologies I had\nPut my heart on display like it was an iMac\nTo all my young niggas, let me be the demonstration\nHow to conduct differences with a healthy conversation\nIf that's your family, then handle it as such\nDon't let the socials gas you up or let emotions be your crutch\nPick up the phone and bust it up before the history is lost\nHand-to-handshake is good when you have a heart-to-heart\n\nUse your heart and not your eyes (Baby, just relax your mind)\nIf you got time and I got time (Yeah, yeah)\nFree your thoughts and watch them fly\nUse your heart and not your eyes (Mm-hmm)"}
