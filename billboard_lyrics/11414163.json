Do you get it?\n\nHahaha\nBut do you get it or not?\nTito Double P, ay!\nAyo\nThat's how your buddy Gabito sounds, man\nMy little one\nOn his little motorcycle\nOoh!\n\nSeven days have passed, and now I accept that you're gone\nThat I'm gonna forget you and alcohol tastes bad\nI already swore for my own good that I won't look at you again\nI won't look at you again\n\nTell me what's wrong with you\nIn the end, you don't even know what you want\nTo forget you, I made love with others\nI don't even mind spending all this cash anymore, watch out\nNot even you understand yourself\nWhere did that forever love go?\nStop pretending you don't love me\n'Cause I can see in your eyes that you do, understand that, understand that"}
