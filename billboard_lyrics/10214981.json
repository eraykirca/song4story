Hell no\nSqueeze every ounce of love from my body, y\u0435ah\n\nYou say move a mountain\nAnd I'll throw on my boots\nYou say stop the river from runnin'\nI'll build a dam or two\nYou say chang\u0435 religion\nNow, I spend Sundays with you\nSomethin' 'bout those tears of yours\nHow does it feel to be adored?\n\nI adore you, I adore you, I adore you, I adore you\nThose alligator tears\nI adore you, I adore you, I adore you, I adore you\nYour alligator tears\nI adore you, I adore you, I adore you, I adore\nAlligator tears\nI adore, I adore you, I adore you, I adore, I adore (How does it feel to be adored?)\nAlligator tears"}
