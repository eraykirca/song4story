Let It Snow!", "artist": "Dean Martin", "lyrics": "Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping\nAnd I've brought me some corn for popping\nThe lights are turned way down low\nLet it snow, let it snow\n\nWhen we finally kiss goodnight\nHow I'll hate going out in the storm\nBut if you really hold me tight\nAll the way home I'll be warm\n\nAnd the fire is slowly dying\nAnd, my dear, we're still goodbyeing\nBut as long as you love me so\nLet it snow, let it snow, and snow\n\nWhen we finally kiss goodnight\nHow I'll hate going out in the storm\nBut if you really grab me tight\nAll the way home I'll be warm\n\nOh, the fire is slowly dying\nAnd, my dear, we're still goodbyeing\nBut as long as you love me so\nLet it snow, let it snow, let it snow"}
