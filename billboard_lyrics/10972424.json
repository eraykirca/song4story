Over there every step\nWe always dreamed of this wealth, shit got right then went left\nLife I'm living get so lonely, all alone, I stay kept\nDo it all by myself, look\nOkay, one, two, free all of my niggas in that system\nFree lil' Smacka, that's my nigga, free T-Weezie, boy, I miss you\nUncle D, it been a minute, hous\u0435 arrest, home det\u0435ntion\nFree my brother Shod in prison, free my daddy, soldier living\nThis the life of a soldier, I'm playing my part\nI got a chip on my shoulder, ache in my heart\nFree all my family members, they tore us apart\nGirl, I need you the most, come back in my arms\nGot so many scars\nSome days, I just lay in my bed, no energy to move\nLife about choices, you live with what you choose\nAnd, oh, so it doesn't try to begin\nWhy is this how the story ends?\n\nAnd I tried my hardest to love you\nThe world was more ready for you\nAnd it's hard, but everyone knows\nIf you love her, then you'll let her go\nAnd last night, I met an angel\nAngel with an attitude\nShe wasn't even half of you\nOh, woah-oh, oh, woah-oh, oh-oh\nYou know I gotta tell the truth\nShe wasn't even half of you\nOh, oh, woah-oh, oh-oh"}
