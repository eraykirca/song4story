I don't know\n\nBut it feels like an eternity\nSince I had you here with me\nSince I had to learn to be\nSomeone you don't know\nTo be with you in paradise\nWhat I wouldn't sacrifice\nWhy'd you have to chase the light\nSomewhere I can't go?\n\nAs I walk this world alone\nAs I walk this world alone\n\nAnother glimpse of what could've been (Ooh)\nAnother dream, another way that it nev\u0435r was\nFalling back in the wilderness (Ooh)\nWaking up, rubbing salt in th\u0435 cut\n\nOh, how long has it been? I don't know\n\nBut it feels like an eternity\nSince I had you here with me\nSince I had to learn to be\nSomeone you don't know\nTo be with you in paradise\nWhat I wouldn't sacrifice\nWhy'd you have to chase the light\nSomewhere I can't go?\n\nAs I walk this world alone (Alone, alone)\nAs I walk this world alone (Alone, alone)\n\nIt's an endless night, it's a starless sky\nIt's a hell that I call home (Hell that I call home)\nIt's a long goodbye on the other side\nOf the only life I know\n\nAnd it feels like an eternity (Mm)\nSince I had you here with me\nSince I had to learn to be (Mm)\nSomeone you don't know (Woah)\nTo be with you in paradise\nWhat I wouldn't sacrifice\nWhy'd you have to chase the light\nSomewhere I can't go?\n\nAs I walk this world alone\nAs I walk this world alone"}
