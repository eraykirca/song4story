(Kill me)\nIt's just a game, but really (Really)\nI'm bettin' on all three (All three) for us two\nGet my car door, isn't that sweet? (That sweet)\nThen pull m\u0435 to the back seat (The back s\u0435at)\nNo one's ever had me (Had me), not like you\n\nTruth, dare, spin bottles\nYou know how to ball, I know Aristotle\nBrand new, full throttle\nTouch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto\nIt's true, swear, scout's honor\nYou knew what you wanted and, boy, you got her\nBrand new, full throttle\nYou already know, babe\n\nI feel like laughin' in the middle of practice\nDo that impression you did of your dad again\nI'm hearing voices like a madman\n\nAnd in the blink of a crinklin' eye\nI'm sinkin', our fingers entwined\nCheeks pink in the twinklin' lights\nTell me 'bout the first time you saw me\nI'll drink what you think and I'm high\nFrom smokin' your jokes all damn night\nThe brink of a wrinkle in time\nBittersweet sixteen suddenly\n\nI'm watchin' American Pie with you on a Saturday night\nYour friends are around, so be quiet\nI'm tryin' to stifle my sighs\n'Cause I feel so high school (I feel so high school) every time I look at you\nBut look at you\n\nTruth, dare, spin bottles (Yeah)\nYou know how to ball, I know Aristotle\nBrand new, full throttle (Yeah)\nTouch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto\nIt's true, swear, scout's honor (Yeah)\nYou knew what you wanted and, boy, you got her\nBrand new, full throttle (Yeah)\nYou already know, babe\nYou already know, babe"}
