Yeah\n\nYou ain't gonna win with the jewelry\nDon't need the cute fuckin' names (No)\nWe don't gotta live out of hotels (Mm-mm)\nWe could do it in my room all day\nAnd I know you could spoil me plenty more\nBut I don't really trust that anymore\nAnd I already got that bag for free (Ah)\nBut if you bought it, then that's sweet (Sweet)\n\nStill, they're just things, they don't mean much\n(They don't mean much, no, no)\nSeen a real good thing\nTurn to real fucked up (Mm, ah)\n\nI just want your two hands on me\nAt all times, baby\nIf you let go (I want your two hands)\nBetter put 'em right back fast\nWant your two hands on me\nLike my life needs savin'\nLet 'em all know (I want your two hands)\nCan you do it like that?
