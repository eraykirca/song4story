Did I miss it? My bad, that's on me\nI see your truck and I don't give a \u2014\nAnd it don't make my heart skip a beat\n\nI-I like not wonderin' where you are tonight\nIt feels so nice finally being on the other side\n\nNow I don't even know what I'm missin'\nDon't care what it is or it isn't\nDon't need your attention (No), or your time\nThey say, \"Did you hear?\"\nI say, \"No thanks I'm fine\"\nI think I could wish you the best\nThe truth is I couldn't care less\nHow sweet it is to be so (So), so indifferent\n\nI'm indifferent, I'm just livin'\nWhen your mama calls I'm reminded you exist\nAnd I wish that she didn't\n'Cause all my \"give-a-damns\", they've already been given\n\nNow I don't even know what I'm missin'\nDon't care what it is or it isn't\nDon't need your attention (No), or your time\nThey say, \"Did you hear?\"\nI say, \"No thanks I'm fine\" (No thanks I'm fine)\nI think I could wish you the best\nThe truth is I couldn't care less (Couldn't care less)\nHow sweet it is to be so (So), so indifferent"}
