Cole Featuring BAS", "lyrics": "We don't do sparklers\nWe give specific instructions to bring out the bottles in stealth mode\nI'm hearing there's rats in the building\nThey sayin' it's not up to par with the health code\nI feel like that's none of my business\nNigga be steadily giving opinions\nOn shit that don't even concern 'em\nI got a lot to get off of my sternum\n\nI been considerin' extending a olive branch\nBuilding bridges with niggas that burned 'em\nLike life too short to hold on to things\nWhen Los was calling my line I stared at the screen whenever the phone would ring\nWish I could've said goodbye, even now I might cry while I'm writing this poem to sing\nLife is a crazy thing\nLook how I got cut from the team, now I own the team\nJust a little piece, I ain't tryna make a scene\nLike it's something it's not, my whole regime is up in the spot\nCarefully watched by dozens of thots\nFuck it, I'll just have a couple of shots\nTake off the edge and get out my head\nWhen you up at the top it's a coveted spot\n\nWe don't do sparklers\nWe give specific instructions to bring out the bottles in stealth mode\nI'm hearing there's rats in the building\nThey sayin' it's not up to par with the health code\nI feel like that's none of my business\nNigga be steadily giving opinions\nOn shit that don't even concern 'em\nI got a lot to get off of my sternum\n\nI got a lot to get off of my sternum\nI got a lot to get off of my sternum, yeah\nBas, you should come right here\n\nNiggas love talking a whole lot of bullshit and calling it guidance\nI been in my mode, I'm not gonna hold you, I doubled my commas\nI cycle through hoes, I gaze on the lotus, get head while I'm drivin'\nYou blow up a phone, we didn't even notice 'cause we was just vibin'\nNiggas love talking a whole lot of bullshit and calling it guidance\nI been in my mode, I'm not gonna hold you, I doubled my commas\nI cycle through hoes, I gaze on the lotus, get head while I'm drivin'\nYou blow up a phone, we didn't even notice 'cause we was just vibin'\n\nWe was just vibin'\nWe was just vibin'"}
