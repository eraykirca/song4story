Uh\nYeah, the look in your eye made me question\n\nWould you hear me more if I whispered in your ear?\nMade all my inner thoughts sound like, \"Ah, ah\"\nWould you hear me more if I touch you right here?\nMade everythin' I want sound like, \"Ah, ah\" (Ah)\n\nWould you hear me, hear me?\nWould you hear me, hear me?\nWould you hear me\nIf all my inner thoughts sound like, \"Ah, ah\"?\n\nI could take it off for you and tell you what I'm goin' through, hm\n'Cause my body positioning determines if you're listenin', ah-ah\n\nDid my dance on your lap pique your interest? Yeah\nNow I got you like that, let me finish\n\nWould you hear me more if I whispered in your ear?\nMade all my inner thoughts sound like, \"Ah, ah\"\nWould you hear me more if I touch you right here?\nMade everythin' I want sound like, \"Ah, ah\" (Ah)\n\nWould you hear me, hear me?\nWould you hear me, hear me? (Would you hear me more? Ooh)\nWould you hear me\nIf all my inner thoughts sound like\u2014\n\nI'm losin' my mind, I'm losin' my head\nYou only listen when I'm undressed\nHear what you like and none of the rest, 'est (Ooh)\nI'm losin' my mind 'cause giving you head's\nThe only time you think I got depth (Ooh)\nHear what you like and none of the rest\n\nWould you hear me more if I whispered in your ear?\nMade all my inner thoughts sound like, \"Ah, ah\"\nWould you hear me more if I touch you right here?\nMade everythin' I want sound like\nWould you hear me more if I whispered in your ear?\nMade all my inner thoughts sound like, \"Ah, ah\"\nWould you hear me more if I touch you right here?\nMade everythin' I want sound like, \"Ah, ah\"\n\nWould you hear me, hear me? (Would you hear?)\nWould you hear me, hear me? (Hear me, babe)\nWould you hear me (Yeah, oh)\nIf all my inner thoughts sound like, \"Ah, ah\"?"}
