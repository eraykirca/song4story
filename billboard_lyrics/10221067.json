Oh, is he gone?\" Oh, I don't know\nI think I left him somewhere I no longer go\nAnd I watch you run away now\nFrom all the lovely things we hate now\nWhere did we go? Where did we go? Oh, I don't know\nBut I know it feels like somewhere far away from home\nAnd it's falling into pieces\nNo, there's not a way that we can stop this now\nOne thousand miles an hour, we're driving off the edge\nAnd, darling, now there's nothing left\nAnd it started out so slowly\n\nOh, as I lay here by myself\nAnd it's 4 a.m., I wonder\nDid I put you through hell? Oh no\nI need to know if you're okay\nI wanna know, I need to know if you're okay, mm\nAnd I hope that you're so damn sure that leaving me was right\nBest thing you ever did, it was leaving me behind\nOh, woo-ooh-ooh, I couldn't blame you if I tried\n\nI guess even the best things fall apart\n\nAnd it started pretty slowly\nOh, when you asked about the old me\n\"Oh, is he gone? Oh, is he gone?\" Oh, I don't know\nI think I left him somewhere I no longer go\nAnd I watch you run away now\nFrom all the lovely things we hate now\nWhere did we go? Where did we go? Oh, I don't know\nBut I know it feels like somewhere far away from home\nAnd it's falling into pieces\nNo, there's not a way that we can stop this now\nOne thousand miles an hour, we're driving off the edge\nAnd, darling, now there's nothing left\n\n(Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nSomewhere deep in you\nSomewhere deep in me\nOh, there's still two lovers\nSo who the hell are we?\nWhen I look at you\nAnd when you look at me\nOh, there's still two lovers\nSo who the hell are we?\nWhen I look at you\nAnd when you look at me\nOh, there's still two lovers\nSo who the hell are we?\nWhen I look at you\nAnd when you look at me\nOh, there's still two lovers\nSo who the hell are we?\n\nWho the hell are we?\n(Oh, who the hell are we?)"}
