Eh (Hey)\n\nAnd for a kiss from that skinny girl, I'd give anything (Anything)\nYou tell me (Tell me), inside or outside (Baby)\nUnderwater, no one will find out\n\nBaby, I'll take you for a stroll on the beach (Ha)\nI'll cover your sweet face with kisses (Your sweet face)\nOne day with me is all you need\nYou look even more beautiful smiling\nBaby, I'll take you for a stroll on the beach\nI'll cover your sweet face with kisses\n\nWith you, I feel different\nThere's something when we look at each other\nAnd in the well, we held hands\nAnd shouted, \"Jacinto!\"\nWhen I'm not at my best\nYou take me to build sandcastles\nAnd the castles turn into little villages\nA small town where problems don't exist\nAnd there, we dream about a future\nA small town where problems don't exist\nWhere we're fine, not lacking much\nFor a second, we forget everything\nHere, it's just you and me\n\nWe'll kiss in front of the waves\nEven if it's just a little peck, a little peck, a little peck, pin-pin, pin-pin-pin\nWe'll kiss in front of the waves\nThere are a lot of mosquitoes on the coast, baby, I'll put up a net\nWe'll kiss in front of the waves\nAll sweaty, the sun hits you and you shine like bling-bling\nWe'll kiss in front of the waves\nLet's stay in Maya, and then I'll take you to Paris\n\nThat's why I love going to the beach with you\nAnd covering your sweet face with kisses\nAnd one day together is all I need\nYou look even more beautiful smiling"}
