Were you a sleeper cell spy?\nIn fifty years, will all this be declassified?\nAnd you'll confess why you did it and I'll say, \"Good riddance\"\n'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden\nI would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside\nAnd you deserve prison, but you won't get time\nYou'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars\nYou crashed my party and your rental car\nYou said normal girls were boring\nBut you were gone by the morning\nYou kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing\n\nAnd in plain sight you hid\nBut you are what you did\nAnd I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive\nThe smallest man who ever lived"}
