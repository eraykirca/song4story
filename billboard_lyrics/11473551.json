Yeah\n\nFriday night, I'm out with the guys\nYou already called me five times\nDrinks are flowing, catching my vibe\nBlue bubbles are blowing up my line\nYou got friends too, no one told you stay inside, go live your life\nYour life\nTextin' me, \"Don't bother comin' home,\" as if the crib ain't mine\nWhat's on your mind? (Your mind) Your mind\nWait on you to sober up the next day 'cause that's when you realize, talkin' on some, oh, damn, I am trippin'\nVaping while you're typin' on a mission\nMaya Angelou off seven shots of '42, your words are cuttin' deep, your words are hittin' different\nAll you gotta do is (All you gotta do)\nAll you gotta do is (All you gotta do)\nHop on 85, drive right past A&M (Past A&M)\nIt's rainin' in Houston, we're not arguing again\nAll this time you've been around me\nYou don't spend a penny 'round me\nFriends are extra friendly 'round me\n\nIf you love me, can I get a woah, woah, woah, woah, woah? (Woah) Yeah\nCan I get a woah, woah, woah, woah? Yeah\n\nAyy, hop on 85, right past A&M\nIt's rainin' in Houston, we're not arguing again\nHop on 85, right past A&M\nGirl, you know the way and we're not arguing again\nIt's rainin' in Houston, my love\nThe streets are empty, mood is already fucked up\nSo why make it worse if you could pull up?\nI know you like it toxic, you're used to it, love\nRather spend my energy boosting you up\nGassing you up, these American guys\nAre something different, they just talk looser than us\nYou say I talk proper, it suits me, my love\nAll these tables, booths, you want hookah, my love\nI'm pulling strings, shit could get acoustic, my love\nCorner booth and pineapple juice in your cup\nBlicky on us these days, it's a glue stick, my love\nI know you always say it's just music, my love\nBut these guys would die to see me losing, my love\nThe hate from this year alone is confusing, my love\nI can't see things getting much smoother, my love"}
