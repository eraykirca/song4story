How can you lose?)\nGot your heart in a headlock\n(How can you lose? How can you lose?)\nI don't believe any of it\n(How can you lose?)\nYou say too late to start\n(How can you lose? How can you lose?)\nWith your heart in a headlock\n(How can you lose? How can you lose?)\nYou know you're better than this\n(How can you lose?)\n\nYou've been walking, you've been hiding\nAnd you look half dead half the time\nMonitoring you, like machines do\nYou've still got it, I'm just keeping an eye\nYou've been walking, you've been hiding (So what?)\nAnd you look half dead half the time (Don't care)\nMonitoring you, like machines do (Will not)\nYou've still got it, I'm just keeping an eye (The end)\nYou know you're better than this\n\nCan't make a start\nGot your heart in a headlock\nNo, I don't believe any of it\nYou say too late to start\nWith your heart in a headlock\nYou know you're better than this\nAfraid to start\n(How can you lose? How can you lose?)\nGot your heart in a headlock\n(How can you lose? How can you lose?)\nI don't believe any of it\n(How can you lose?)\nYou say too late to start\n(How can you lose? How can you lose?)\nWith your heart in a headlock\n(How can you lose? How can you lose?)\nYou know you're better than this\n(How can you lose?)"}
