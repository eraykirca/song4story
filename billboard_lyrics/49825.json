Can't you see?\nRain all day and I don't mind\n\nBut the telephone singing, ringing, it's too early, don't pick it up\nWe don't need to\nWe got everything we need right here and everything we need is enough\nJust so easy when\nThe whole world fits inside of your arms\nDo we really need to pay attention to the alarm?\nWake up slow, mmm-mmm, wake up slow\n\nBut baby\nYou hardly even notice when I try to show you this\nSong, it's meant to keep you from doing what you're supposed to\nLike waking up too early, maybe we could sleep in\nMake you banana pancakes, pretend like it's the weekend now\n\nAnd we could pretend it all the time\nCan't you see that it's just raining?\nThere ain't no need to go outside\n\nAin't no need, ain't no need\nRain all day and I really, really, really don't mind\nCan't you see? Can't you see?\nWe've got to wake up slow"}
