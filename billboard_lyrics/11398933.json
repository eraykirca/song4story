Do you see me now?\nI've been waiting for you, cryin' out\nDo you see me? Do you see me now?\n\nSaw your face and mine\nIn a picture by our bedside\nIt was cold in the summertime\nWe were happy just to be alive\nCan I vanish into you?\nCan I vanish into you? (Yah)\n\nInto the night, we fly\nSirens blow by our heads (Yah)\n\nDo you see me? Do you see me now?\nI've been waiting for you, cryin' out\nDo you see me? Do you see me now?\n\nSaw your face and mine\nIn a picture by our bedside\nIt was cold in the summertime\nWe were happy just to be alive\nCan I vanish into you?\nCan I vanish into you?\n\n(Yah)\n\nSaw your face and mine\nIn a picture by, by, by, by my bedside\nIt was cold in the summertime\nWe were happy just to be alive\nCan I, I vanish into you?\nCan I vanish into you? (Can I? Can I?)\nLike a ghost, I, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, vanish into you\nCan I vanish into you?\n\nWhen I die, can I vanish into you?"}
