(Yeah, oh, oh)\nWon't you please bring my baby to me?\n\nOh, I don't want a lot for Christmas\nThis is all I'm asking for (Ah)\nI just wanna see my baby\nStanding right outside my door\n\nOh, I just want you for my own (Ooh)\nMore than you could ever know (Ooh)\nMake my wish come true\nOh baby, all I want for Christmas is you\n\nYou, baby\nAll I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)\nAll I want for Christmas is you, baby (Ah, oh, ah, oh)\nAll I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)\nAll I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I really want, baby, ooh)\nAll I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I want, all I really want is you)"}
