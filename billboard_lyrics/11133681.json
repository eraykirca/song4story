Must have taken you some time\nI can't help but wonder what your parents make of you and I\nLet's go to Nice\nAnd give your sister a niece\nI'm tryna make the population increase\nI'm tryna see you indec' 'fore we head back East\nYour mom called askin' when you plan to be home\nIt's been a week or so longer than you said you'd be gone\nYou say you love her, then you ask her what the family's on\nBefore you hang up on her, hand me the phone, so I can say\n\n\"Hello, Miss Johnson, you know why I'm callin'\nYou know I've been fallin', fallin' for your daughter\nI think about her often, correct me if I'm wrong, but\nWas it you that gave the eyes to her I be lost in?
