(Uh-huh)\nTell your mama (Tell your mama)\nTell your daddy (Tell your daddy)\nTell the world (Uh)\nTell the world\n\nLike sugar on my tongue\nCan I steal that from you?\nLike sugar on my tongue\nCan I steal that from you?\n\nAre you from Harlem? Make your arms and legs shake, uh-huh\nGive me that slice of cream, is it your birthday? Uh-huh\nI got a brush, give me your walls and I'll paint, uh-huh\nDon't need no air, I stay down there 'til I faint (Girl, I'm dead)\n\nTell your mama (Tell 'em what? Tell your mama, uh)\nTell your daddy (Tell 'em what? Tell your daddy, uh)\nTell your mama (Tell your mama)\nTell your daddy (Tell your daddy)\nTell the world (Uh-uh, woah)\n\nLike sugar on my tongue\nCan I steal that from you?\nLike sugar on my tongue\nCan I steal that before I go?\n\nYou wanna eat me up? You wanna be my friend?\nYou wanna get me up and never be locked in?\nI wanna take you down, you wanna be my thing\nOh no, no, no, no (Take me down, yeah)\nOh-woah, oh-oh (Eat you up)\nOh-woah, oh-oh (Girl, I'll eat you up)\nOh-woah, oh-oh-oh (I'll eat you up)\nOh-woah, oh-oh\n\nLet me just taste it (Can I eat you up?)\nAin't gotta cuff or nothing (Eat you up, yeah, yeah)\nI promise, I'll take you out on a date\nJust trust me (Eat you up)"}
