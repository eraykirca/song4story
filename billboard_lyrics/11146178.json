I kept my promise\nYeah, we deserve it all\nA better life for my daughter\nMade my son take it further than his father\nYeah, he deserves it all\nA close relationship with God\nWhisper to me every time I close my eyes\nHe say, \"You deserve it all\"\nKeep these bitch niggas away from me\nKeep all my blessings faithfully\nKeep my essence contagious, that's okay with me\nI burn this bitch down, don't you play with me or stay with me\nI'm crashin' out right now, no one's safe with me\nI did it with integrity and niggas still try hate on me, just wait and see\nMore blood be spillin', it's just paint to me\nDangerously, nothin' changed with me, still got pain in me\nFlip a coin, want the shameless me or the famous me?\nHow annoying, does it angers me to know the lames can speak\nOn the origins of the game I breathe? That's insane to me\nIt's important, I deserve it all because it's mine\nTell me why you think you deserve the greatest of all time, motherfucker\n\nI deserve it all\nI deserve it all"}
