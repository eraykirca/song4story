They called it all off\"\nOne gasp and then\n\"How did it end?\"\n\nSay it once again with feeling\nHow the death rattle breathing\nSilenced as the soul was leaving\nThe deflation of our dreaming\nLeaving me bereft and reeling\nMy beloved ghost and me\nSitting in a tree\nD-Y-I-N-G\n\nIt's happenin' again\nHow did it end?\nI can't pretend like I understand\nHow did it end?\n\nCome one, come all, it's happenin' again\nThe empathetic hunger descends\nWe'll tell no one except all of our friends\nBut I still don't know\nHow did it end"}
