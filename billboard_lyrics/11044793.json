(Judy, Judy, Judy)\nAnd she was great with women, exhibitionist (Judy, Judy, Judy, Judy)\nI lean voyeur, so it worked out (Judge Judy, oh my God)\nOur frequencies matched (Oh, na-na-na-na)\nNo pressure, just, just\nShe wrote me a letter\nSorry that I haven't been communicating much (Uh, ooh, ooh, ooh)\nThis past year has been rough, it spreaded to my head (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nI knew it when we met, if you're reading, it's too late\nI'm on the other side, but I just wanna say\nThank you for the moments I could grab before I left (Wait)\nI hope you live your life, your truest self with no regrets\nI wasn't living right until they told me what was left\nI'm wishing you the best, P.S.\nThank you for not judging, Judy\nDamn"}
