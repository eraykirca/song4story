(Get up)\nSlide in, slide in\nWould you ride?\nBaby, would you ride for me? (Get up)\n\nShe know what I like, got me in a twilight\nHeaded to the high-rise, cruisin' like Eyes Wide Shut (Get up)\nBut I slide in it like a drive-by\nThe industry don't like me, tell them pussy niggas likewise (Get up)\nThey tried to hit me with the cyanide\nNice try (Get up)\nIf you play with one of my guys, it's gon' be a homicide twice\nWe gon' paint the city red, it's tie-dye, ask Ty (Get up)\nAddicted to the nightlife, jumpin' off a jet, skydive\nYour life a movie, mine a sci-fi (Get up)\nTold her friends she a ten, I lied\nReally, she in the high fives (Get up)\n\nSlide in, slide in\nWould you ride?\nBaby, would you ride with me? (Get up)\nSlide in, slide in\nWould you ride?\nBaby, would you ride for me? (Get up)\n\nBaby, would you ride with me? (Get up)\n(Get up)\nBaby, would you ride with me? (Get up)\n(Get up)"}
