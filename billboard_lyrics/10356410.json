inside this climate\nYou a woman, so you know how it feels to be in alignment\nWith emotion, hopin' a man can see you and not be blinded\nDear Dennis, you gave birth to a master manipulator\nEven using you to prove who he is is a huge favor\nI think you should ask for more paper, and more paper\nAnd more, uh, more paper\nI'm blamin' you for all his gamblin' addictions\nPsychopath intuition, the man that like to play victim\nYou raised a horrible fuckin' person, the nerve of you, Dennis\nSandra, sit down, what I'm about to say is heavy, now listen, mm-mm\nYour son's a sick man with sick thoughts, I think niggas like him should die\nHim and Weinstein should get fucked up in a cell for the rest they life\nHe hates Black women, hypersexualize 'em with kinks of a nympho fetish\nGrew facial hair because he understood bein' a beard just fit him better\nHe got sex offenders on ho-VO that he keep on a monthly allowance\nA child should never be compromised and he keepin' his child around them\nAnd we gotta raise our daughters knowin' there's predators like him lurkin'\nFuck a rap battle, he should die so all of these women can live with a purpose\nI been in this industry twelve years, I'ma tell y'all one lil' secret\nIt's some weird shit goin' on and some of these artists be here to police it\nThey be streamlinin' victims all inside of they home and callin' 'em tender\nThen leak videos of themselves to further push their agendas\nTo any woman that be playin' his music, know that you're playin' your sister\nOr better, you're sellin' your niece to the weirdos, not the good ones\nKatt Williams said, \"Get you the truth,\" so I'ma get mines\nThe Embassy 'bout to get raided too, it's only a matter of time\nAyy, LeBron, keep the family away, hey, Curry, keep the family away\nTo anybody that embody the love for their kids, keep the family away\nThey lookin' at you too if you standin' by him, keep the family away\nI'm lookin' to shoot through any pervert that lives, keep the family safe\n\nDear baby girl\nI'm sorry that your father not active inside your world\nHe don't commit to much but his music, yeah, that's for sure\nHe a narcissist, misogynist, livin' inside his songs\nTry destroyin' families rather than taking care of his own\nShould be teaching you time tables or watchin' Frozen with you\nOr at your eleventh birthday singin' poems with you\nInstead, he be in Turks payin' for sex and poppin' Percs, examples that you don't deserve\nI wanna tell you that you're loved, you're brave, you're kind\nYou got a gift to change the world, and could change your father's mind\n'Cause our children is the future, but he lives inside confusion\nMoney's always been illusion, but that's the life he's used to\nHis father prolly didn't claim him neither\nHistory do repeats itself, sometimes it don't need a reason\nBut I would like to say it's not your fault that he's hidin' another child\nGive him grace, this the reason I made Mr. Morale\nSo our babies like you can cope later\nGive you some confidence to go through somethin', it's hope later\nI never wanna hear you chase a man 'cause it's feral behavior\nSittin' in the club with sugar daddies for validation\nYou need to know that love is eternity and trumps all pain\nI'll tell you who your father is, just play this song when it rains\nYes, he's a hitmaker, songwriter, superstar, right\nAnd a fuckin' deadbeat that should never say \"more life\"\nMeet the Grahams\n\nDear Aubrey\nI know you probably thinkin' I wanted to crash your party\nBut truthfully, I don't have a hatin' bone in my body\nThis supposed to be a good exhibition within the game\nBut you fucked up the moment you called out my family's name\nWhy you had to stoop so low to discredit some decent people?\nGuess integrity is lost when the metaphors doesn't reach you\nAnd I like to understand 'cause your house was never a home\nThirty-seven, but you showin' up as a seven-year-old\nYou got gamblin' problems, drinkin' problems, pill-poppin' and spendin' problems\nBad with money, whorehouse\nSolicitin' women problems, therapy's a lovely start\nBut I suggest some ayahuasca, strip the ego from the bottom\nI try to empathize with you 'cause I know that you ain't been through nothin'\nCrave entitlement, but wanna be liked so bad that it's puzzlin'\nNo dominance, let's recap moments when you didn't fit in\nNo secret handshakes with your friend\nNo culture cachet to binge, just disrespectin' your mother\nIdentity's on the fence, don't know which family will love ya\nThe skin that you livin' in is compromised in personas\nCan't channel your masculine even when standin' next to a woman\nYou a body shamer, you gon' hide them baby mamas, ain't ya?\nYou embarrassed of 'em, that's not right, that ain't how mama raised us\nTake that mask off, I wanna see what's under them achievements\nWhy believe you? You never gave us nothin' to believe in\n'Cause you lied about religious views, you lied about your surgery\nYou lied about your accent and your past tense, all is perjury\nYou lied about your ghostwriters, you lied about your crew members\nThey all pussy, you lied on 'em, I know they all got you in 'em\nYou lied about your son, you lied about your daughter, huh\nYou lied about them other kids that's out there hopin' that you come\nYou lied about the only artist that can offer you some help\nFuck a rap battle, this a long life battle with yourself"}
