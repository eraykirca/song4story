Oh\nI still love you, head to toe, yeah\nLike the back of my car on a sunny day\nYou're the song on the radio I never play\nYou're the words in my soul that I wanna say, yeah, I wanna say\nSo won't you make me stay?\n\nWon't you take me home?\nSend me shivers somewhere I used to go\nWrap my name across your mouth\nWhen I let my feelings down\nDarling, won't you take me home?\nYeah, won't you take me\n\nOh-oh, oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh, oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh, oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh, oh-oh-oh"}
