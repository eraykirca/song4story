I can't tell\nShe say things I do for her, I did for someone else\nI'm just tryna help, make me feel bad about myself\nLike my love language ain't felt, damn\n(I just wanna ride with you), I just wanna ride\n(I just wanna go out), I just wanna catch my vibe\nI just wanna ride with you\nI just wanna ball out\n\nI just wanna ride with you\nI just wanna ball out\nI just wanna ride with you\nI just wanna ball out"}
