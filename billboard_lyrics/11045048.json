My shit spinnin', spinnin', spinnin', like a ceiling fan\nNo alcohol, no pill in hand\nMy only vice is them sweets and them wheels I spin\nYou better calm that down\n'Fore that nigga pop that round and T.O. will not be found\nHot, hot glue in my palm like ooh, Spider-Man velcro, nigga, I'm not you, I\nAlmost had a mini me, I wasn't ready\nAnd she wanted it with me, I'm talkin' heavy\nThen we had to guarantee, ain't no confetti\nFour million on that car, that's not a Chevy\nSee, that's my interest, so as of now, raisin' a child is not on my wish list (Nope)\nNeither is bein' safety net for bitches\nI'm too selfish, contradiction (Ah)\nMaybe I should before I'm too old and washed up like dishes (Washed)\nNever bite tongue 'til a tooth sore\nIf you was gon' apologize, fuck you shoot for? Phew-phew\nWhen I pop out, they say, \"Ooh, Lord\"\nNo Met Gala, but I'm everybody mood board\nI did a whole collection, collections in Paris\nThey ain't even send me the collection to wear it\nI'm so embarrassed, but happy that it happened\nFuck what you heard, I ain't coon, I ain't tappin'\nAlways some corn from you niggas who ain't poppin', haters\nAlways ride another nigga wave, you a sailor\nYou could never moonwalk in my Chuck Taylors, brodie\nYou niggas is jabronis\nI'm from the city where they ran up in Sauconys\nThirty-one zero, shit thirsty, yuck\nBitch sued for a mil', tryna work me\nSettled at a mil' 'cause that million couldn't hurt me (Ugh)\nIt didn't hurt me (Ugh)\nNah, it ain't hurt shit (Ugh)\nSent the motherfuckin' wire, did a backflip (Mm)\nAnd if I shoot the club up, it's a Black bitch (Don't say that)\nOn the plane by myself, I ain't pack shit (Ugh)\nYeah, eating candy yams and some catfish\nHm, yeah, that rich, fuck what you heard, I'm that nigga and I'm that bitch\n\nI hope you find your way home\nReal shit, I'm proud of you\nI'm proud of you, bro\nLike, you just never cease to amaze me, like, you just\u2014\nThere's no words right now how I feel\nDo your thing, just keep, keep shinin'\n(Run it, run it, run it back, run it back)\n(The light comes from within)\n(The light comes from within)\n(The light comes from within)\n(The light comes from within)\n(The light)\nI hope you find your way home\n(Chromakopia, Chromakopia, Chromakopia)"}
