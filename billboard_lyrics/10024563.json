Let's hear one mor\u0435 joke\nThen we could all just laugh until I cry\n\nSo I l\u0435ap from the gallows and I levitate down your street\nCrash the party like a record scratch as I scream\n\"Who's afraid of little old me?\"\nI was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean\n\"Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth\"\nWho's afraid of little old me?\nWell, you should be\n\n(You should be) You should be\n(You should be) You should be\nYou should be (You should be)\nYou should be (You should be)\nYou should be\n\nSo tell me everything is not about me\nBut what if it is?\nThen say they didn't do it to hurt me\nBut what if they did?\nI wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me\nYou wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me\nSo all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs\nI'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?\nThat I'll sue you if you step on my lawn\nThat I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong\nPut narcotics into all of my songs\nAnd that's why you're still singin' along\n\nSo I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street\nCrash the party like a record scratch as I scream\n\"Who's afraid of little old me?\"\nI was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean\n\"Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth\"\nWho's afraid of little old me?\nWell, you should be\n\n(You should be) You should be\n(You should be) You should be\n'Cause you lured me (You should be)\nAnd you hurt me (You should be)\nAnd you taught me\n\nYou caged me and then you called me crazy\nI am what I am 'cause you trained me\nSo who's afraid of me?\nWho's afraid of little old me?\nWho's afraid of little old me?"}
