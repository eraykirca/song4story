Feel it fading\nYou can take away my tattoos, the scars on my heart, we'll\u205freplace\u205f'em\nAnd\u205fI don't even\u205flike to party,\u205fbut I'm going out tonight\n'Cause I know that's the type, but shit that you don't like\nIn the section sending text messages, but avoided it\nIn the club tryna wrap my head around and what's the point of this?\nIt's so hard to right my wrongs\nWill you miss me when I'm gone?\nThink I'm better off alone\nAre you better on your own? (Yeah)\nAnd we were such a fairy tale (Yeah)\nYou were there, I was there\nYou can do bad by yourself (Yourself)\nIf you don't care, I don't care\nAnd there you go again playing (Yeah, yeah)\nWhy are you always playing? (Oh)\nWas it real or was you faking?\nWhat about the time that we wasted? (Wasted)\n\nWas it even love? (Uh, uh, uh, uh)\nIs it even love? (Uh-uh, uh)\nWas it even love? (Uh-uh, uh)\nGo get even, love (Uh-uh, uh)\n\n'Cause I know I will\nAnd I know I will\nUh\nGrrah"}
