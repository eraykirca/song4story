(Yeah)\n\nOh-oh, oh-oh\nWhen you dance for me, you give it your all\nOh-oh, oh-oh\nWhen we're alone, everything goes\nMy feelings can't be expressed with this pen\nAyy, how can I tell you?\nYou are the infinite exponent, the equi', the sum\nThe moon is too small for you (Yah!)\nAnd even though I'm far away, you are the closest person to me\nIf my cell phone were to turn off, I would only notify you\nIf there was life before, I must've drank from your waters\nI was destined to meet you\n\nThe best thing I've got\nIs the love you give to me\nIt smells of tobacco and melon\nAnd a Sunday in the city\nIf you wait for me\nI could double the time\nI could tie heaven up\nAnd give it to you entirely\n\nI want you to give me another kiss\nOne of those that you give me\nBeing away from you is hell\nBeing close to you is my peace\nAnd it's because I love whenever you arrive\nAnd I hate when you leave\nI'll be with you 'til death\nDon't leave me alone, where are you going, where are you going?\n\nYou smoke as if you were going to be kicked out for it\nAnd you dance the way a god would move when dancing\nAnd you kiss like you've always known how to kiss\nAnd nobody had to teach you, you\n\nThe best thing I've got\nIs the love you give to me\nIt smells of tobacco and melon\nAnd a Sunday in the city\nAnd if you wait for me, eh\nI could double the time\nI could tie heaven up\nAnd give it to you entirely\n\nI need another kiss\nOne of those that you give me\nBeing away from you is hell\nBeing close to you is my peace\nAnd it's because I love whenever you arrive\nAnd I hate when you leave\nI'll be with you 'til death\nDon't leave me alone, where are you going, where are you going?\n\nNa-na-na, na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na, na-na-na\nNa-na-na, na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na, na-na-na-na"}
