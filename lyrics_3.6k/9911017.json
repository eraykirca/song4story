Yeah\n\nI wanna know if someone's out th\u0435re (Save me)\nCould you b\u0435, could you be mine?\nIf we ain't got love, then we got nothing (We got nothing)\nThen we got nothing\n\nAll my life, all my life\nI've been runnin' around, I've been tryin' to find\nAll my life, all my life\nI've been lookin' for love, I'm still lookin' tonight\n\nAre you the one to free my heart?\nAre you the spotlight in the dark?\nAre you the one to free my heart?
