Why?\nSuch a foolish reason, I'm afraid. I just wanted to kiss you\n\nDu-du, du-du-du-du, du-du\nDu-du, du-du-du-du, du-du\nDu-du, du-du-du-du, du-du\nDu-du, du-du-du-du, du-du\n\nBecause love can burn like a cigarette (Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du)\n(Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du)\nAnd leave you with nothin' (Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du)\nAnd leave you with nothin' (Du)"}
