Who better than me?\nYou better believe it never could be, I'm ready to eat\nThey better get it ready for me, I'm killin' the scene\nThey gotta get a medical team, the gun a machine\nThe tongue is a gun, it come with a beam\nIt come in the red, it come in the green\nAnd somebody scared 'cause nobody seen it\nGet him a bed and get him a king, and get a machete\nGive it a swing, I'm thinkin' of deadly things\nD-d-drinkin' red drink (Uh), red rum, red rum (Look), 1-5-1, '87 (Uh)\nLook alive, lil' nigga, they be livin' a lie\nI never believe the song that said they could fly\nThe last nigga I seen tried it, did it and died\nGet a better disguise, you ain't figured it out\nNiggas ain't tryna get victimized\nI got a pit and a clip, finna sick the boy\nDon't nobody wanna get sent to God\nThe stick hit through meat like a shish kebob (Ayy, c'mon, like, bro)\nTake it up with the boss, man, I'm good at my job\nIt's not a walk in a park 'cause I'm in a metropolis\nI'm lost in a thought, but escapin' the darkness\nCaught the broad day, like sun and parked it\nFelt the force and found my flow, the faucet\nKept the course ahead, no matter the cost\nI only eat what I kill, do away with the carcass\nMonster dreadlockness, similar concepts\n\n(A dreadlockness monster, a monster, ah)\n\nI'm a crazy man, I had to get into the game again\nI'm seein' the lights, I'm lookin' at the lay of the land\nI'm in command like I'm Jayden Daniels, breakin' in\nCan't evade a vandal, nigga, save the scandal\nService candle lit 'cause your man a bitch\nI tried to understand but I'm lackin' the bandwith\nA rock in a hard place, crack in a sandwich\nThe cards I was handed determined the gambit\nIt made me the man, but it turned me into Manson\nSon of a madman Max, minimal chances\nShakin' the hand, white man take it to taxes\nSuit and a tie, not fly, ride in a backseat of a taxi\nI feel like Tyrese Maxey, I'm a zone Sixer, but I'm a hell of a athlete\nDoin' the rap shit, take a look at the rap sheet\nNigga's a random, ratchet, here with a black queen\nAngela Bassett, put a tab of acid on your tongue\nI ain't never takin' a bump\nBut I can put it in a package, you give me a lump sum\nThen put it in a bag in the back of a trunk\nI heard thump, thump, thump, thump, bangin' the bass\nI'm breakin' the bread, the breakfast, I'm bringin' the bacon\nSlangin' the sausage, crackin' the egg over your face\nI'm half-amazin', half man and half alien\nYeah, patience been paper thin, I plant a flag in every place I'm in\nPace has been immense, it's not a race, but I been chasin' it\nBeen unforsaken, only placin' faith in the hands that turned the staff into a snake\nAnd then a snake into a staff again\nThe average couldn't start to establish the type of bag I'm in\nThe nappiest, East Atlanta\u2014\nRappin' erratic, righteous and ratchet 'cause that's what's happenin'\nYellin' from the mountains so loud, it could start a avalanche\nWe in Babylon, by the way, you, brother, be babblin'\nYou out of chances, I can't overextend a olive branch\nFuck the bargainin', we bargin' in, let the car spin\nPush a Porsche with the nine, one-one like I'm Micah Parsons\nWhen attackin' a target, half a sack when they sent the blitz\nIt's a rapid departure, real rappers cease to exist\nLike it's open season, soon as they seen him, it's, \"Oh, shit\"\nBaow, baow, eight-one like Kobe in '06\nHead bowed, pray for 'em while you load this 45th\n23, y'ain't started, but hit the Jordan with the Pippen assist\nAnother plot is just a twist in the script\nIf we beefin', let's get into some ol' biblical shit\nAin't no tweetin', see you, goodnight, and then proceed with a kiss\nFor the dead, watch for the threads, niggas can't bleed on my fit\nPut to bed, now we even Steven, keep a Stephen A. Smith\nAnd a Wess', fuck all that screamin' shit and beatin' your chest\nMomma says mentality breathes into a seed of success\nAnd I'm between it, but best believe, I ain't perceivin' no threats\nWith allegiance, alliance, leave me out of y'all shit, I'm a lion, I'm lyin', relax\nYou know the facts of the sleeping giant, align me with that\nNigga, Goliath's a bitch, hit with a rock and a sack\nMy nigga ride with a stick, flippin' a rock and, oh, wait\nNothin' too hard to predict, know shit been hard where you at\nBut if I lost you, then I bring it back\n\nI beat up a beat like a drum machine did somethin' to me\nYou don't wanna go and bump into me, I jump into beef so comfortably\nI'm not comfortable with no conflict, I've come for the bull\nGimme them horns, gimme that rose bush, gimme them thorns\nI'm another breed, I'm a different animal\nY'all make me yawn, like a strand of wool (Ugh)\nI'm intangible, but your hands are full\nAnd your lil' underpants are pulled all the way down to your ankles\nYou're gettin' spanked and I'm your father\nTold ya I'm a soldier, I just showed up in a wife-beater tank and I'ma demolish\nI always said when I didn't have a dime to my name and lived in squalor\nIf I had three quarters, two dimes and a nickel\nI wouldn't change for a dollar\nBut I signed 50 Cent and put him in my piggy bank\nAnd I ain't gonna apolo\u2014\n\u2014Gize to you for what the fuck I do, my advice to you, get five bazookas\nSome type of nuke, a knife or Ruger the size of two guns\n'Cause I'm sprayin' the Rossi like I'm N.W.A. and the Posse\nJust like Yella, Ren, Dre and them taught me\nMan, look at all the mayhem I'm causing\nThat's prolly why I stay in the hot seat\nWith these magazines, I act out like Ye and his cousin\nLittle cocksucker, I'm sprayin' and bustin'\nYour shit sucks dick, stop sayin' it doesn't\nThat's probably the reason there's nothin' you've bodied of recent\nI feel like I just walked in and seen you naked, 'cause you not even decent\nGet ripped like my school clothing\nLike a sleeping cow, I'm bulldozing\nA rap god since my socks were holey\nWas on that block like a soccer goalie\nMa could not control me, Glocks, I'm toting\nLock and loading, rock and rolling, rock a Rollie\nGuacamole, mostaccioli, like this flow, you're out of pocket, homie\nY'all could only hope to catch the flow, but if you know, you know\nI told you hoes to slow your rolls before you go and throw your whole career up in the toilet bowl, enjoy the G.O.A.T\nThis my house of horrors, like a brothel\nI done put Ja Rule through it like a law school\nKeep it a stack, like pancakes, I'm awful\nSo many plaques from Belgium, got a wall full\nIn fact, you would hate my walls, they're all full\nThey call me Marshall, but I'm unlawful\nIs it Groundhog's Day or d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?\nWon't stop, period, post-menopausal\nGo so postal that most postman'll pause, I'll slaughter the rhyme\nThese flows gonna boggle the mind\nY'all get in line, you're talkin' to Einstein\nFuck walkin' the line, I'm joggin' it\nI'm a cross between a dog and a juvenile-ish, motherfuckin' childish punk\nAnd I be poppin' the most wildest junk\nAnd I'm known as the prick that's not to fuck wit'\nCall me erectile dysfunction, my ballistic missile is launchin'\nI'm wildin' like Seven Mile and Runyon, bunch of violent gunmen\nI do it like Puff do it, tell my hitters to hit him up, \"Do it\"\nSo like my middle fingers to a Tupac song, you know that I put 'em up to it\n12-gauge at the age of twelve, caged-up self-rage, I been raisin' Hell\nLike I'm Joe, Jam Master Jay and Darryl, brace yourself\nIt's about to be a fuckin' shootout like the OK Corral\nBounty on me like a paper towel\nThey want me to go on the straight and narrow\nLike the same shape that they make an arrow\nNever sell out for the fame and wealth\nDave Chappelle of the rap game, I'm never gonna play myself\nClosest I ever came's 8 Mile, but the fuckin' pain I felt\nWhen I lost Proof, couldn't explain how that devil came down\nThen in one fell, he swooped, look at how foul he's stooped\nHad to throw in that towel, regroup, like Sean O'Malley, still that mouthy youth\nThis here the finale, try to rally troops, better round up and corral recruits\nBut no matter how many you tally to surround these two\nYou gon' fuck around and find out just what the fuck we about when you see how we shoot\nAnd I ain't talkin' about how we hoop when you lay up in a motherfuckin' alley, oops\nIt's like a Xanadu for every Xan' I do, what I plan to do is take a pink and a blue\nHand a few to me, I'll brutally damage you, I could never stand to lose\nI'm bananas, you motherfuckers can't do it sicker than I do\nYou couldn't get rid of this shit with Tamiflu\nCannibals, you little bitch, me and JID are just like bestiality, we fuckin' animals\nI'm back and I'm body baggin' 'em, toe-taggin' 'em in the back of the Volkswagen\nAnd draggin' them hoebags and I'm throat-gaggin' 'em\n'Til I get thrown back in the paddy wagon and back on the Prozac\nAnd I know that, but I'm so bad with a notepad that it don't matter\nThe GOAT's back, finna go at anyone who got the gonads or cojones, yeah"}
