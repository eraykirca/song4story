All that vibe you had\nAll that fight you had on you\nI want them but I want you too\nHow can both those things be true?\n\nOoh, when can I see you? (True)\nOoh, when can I see you?\nOoh, when can I see you?\nOoh, when can I see you? (True)\n\nI love her and I need her\nShe keeps givin' me fever, fever, yeah\nLike blowin' on sativa\nShe keeps takin' me deeper, deeper, yeah\nIt's all ups and downs I found\nWhen she comes around, she be givin' me fever, fever, uh\nNow go throw the past away\nWe ain't guaranteed to see a better day, better day, uh"}
