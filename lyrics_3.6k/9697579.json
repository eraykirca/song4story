Cole", "lyrics": "Pull off and I almost hit him\nHe actin' like I ain't always with him\nMy heart sayin' I love him while I'm screamin' out I hate him\nAnd ain't no more debatin', this time, it's a ultimatum\nI never forgot where I was at the first day I met him\nYeah, it was love at first sight, but I ain't never sweat him\nI knew if it was meant to be that one day I would let him\nTwenty years later, them decisions, I don't regret them\nJust wish you would give me space when I really need it\nTo be alone in my zone when I'm really heated\nJust 'cause I am quiet, don't mean you're defeated\nWish you ain't need me to feel like you're completed\nDon't wanna say somethin' mean when I don't mean it\nMillion missed calls, I don't wanna talk\nJust did a detox, now I wanna spark\n\nI wrote a line for you and it was beautiful\nI made a song for you to say you're beautiful\nYou're so, so irresistible\nTake me to somewhere mystical\nYou're so\nDo you know?\nFor you, I promise I'll try\nFor you, I promise I'll try\nFor you, I promise I'll try\n\nUh, havin' her ain't for the faint of heart\nShe bad as fuck but hard to deal with, and it ain't her fault\nShe got ambition like the niggas, and the vision for herself\nSo she can't rest until she feel like she done made her mark\nSo if you love her, then you gotta learn to play your part\nSometimes you gotta play the back\nBut when you do, make sure you play it smart\nAll these niggas want her, so they hatin' hard\nThey talkin' slick and make you wanna pull a rated-R\nYou like her, love her like a brother, like her manager, an A&R\nPlus a therapist when it start rainin' hard\nHer life was trauma filled, it left her with a tainted heart\nYet you the nigga that she wanna tat her name across\nBut you need patience and a lot of extra faith from God\nTo keep the family together at a time when it's so regular to break apart\nSo God forbid, y'all got a kid, therefore, I hate the thought\nIt's you and her against the world until there ain't no more breath in your lungs\nI'm just a messenger, but God is who this message is from\nI wanna send you my respect because I rep for the ones\nThat hold they wifey down despite all of the extras that come\nWord to Willy Smith, these silly niggas heckle and shun\nAs if they life is somehow perfect and they never been plunged\nInto a dark place, so I can't respect when it's done\nIt's family first through the worst, comin' second to none, for real\n\nI wrote a line for you and it was beautiful\nI made a song for you to say you're beautiful\nYou're so, so irresistible\nTake me to somewhere mystical\nYou're so\nFor you, know\nFor you, I promise I'll try"}
