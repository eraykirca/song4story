But I should've gone out with her mate instead\nI always pick the wrong people, they make me feel like I'm sick in the head\nSo then I go on a daydream where I know that I'm wrong and it makes me right\nYou looked cool this morning, do you wanna go out tonight?\n\n'Cause I, I wanna feel good emotions in this lovesick lullaby\n\nLullaby\nLovesick lullaby\nLovesick lullaby (Lovesick, lovesick)\nLovesick lullaby (Lovesick, lovesick)\nLovesick lullaby (Lovesick, lovesick)\nLovesick lullaby (Lovesick, lovesick)\nLullaby\n\nI bought some hash from a dealer in a pathetic attempt to impress my friends\nBut they didn't like it, so I kept it all to myself instead\nThen I went back to the man's house and he completely fucking changed my life\nHe told me this story about a lovesick lullaby\n\nHash man, Hash man, go round the roundabout\nHash man, Hash man, go round the roundabout\nHash man, Hash man, go round the roundabout\nHash man, Hash man, go round the roundabout\n\n'Cause I, I wanna feel good emotions in a la-la-la-la-la-la\n'Cause I, I wanna feel good emotions in this lovesick lullaby\n\nLovesick lullaby, lovesick lullaby, lovesick lullaby, lovesick lullaby"}
