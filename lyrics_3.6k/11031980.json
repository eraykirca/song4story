Nah, that ain't the energy\nThat version of T that you knew is a memory\nWho is that? You niggas get too attached to hear it\nFear it, face clear, few wrinkles on my spirit\nNow, cousin, this ain't no tubbin'\nI don't like cages, I'd rather be flooded\nThought this shit out, I pop out with that oven\nTell that new version of me that I'm comin', yeah\nMy brodie had another baby, that's like number two (Number two)\nMy homegirl a knot-tier, she like thirty-two (Thirty-two)\nThey sharin' pictures of these moments, shit is really cute\nAnd all I got is photos of my 'Rari and some silly suits (Man)\nMhm, will I flip the switch and finally settle down?\nMhm, or go the other way and keep my panties down?\nUh-huh, I'm too paranoid, so I'ma air it out\nAnd any pressure that you puttin' on me, I'ma tear it down\n\nDon't you wait on me (Don't you wait on me), I'll be fine\nDon't you wait on me (Don't you wait on me), I'll be fine\nDon't you wait for me\n'Cause time got nothing right"}
