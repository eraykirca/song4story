Do you, just hate losin'?\nHere you come again, who could it be?\nIt's 3 a.m., no caller ID\n\nI don't need to see your name\nWho else would drunk-call me this late?\nSurprise, surprise, you haven't changed\nI'm sure, you're sure I'll pick up\nAnd I shouldn't want to, but I do\nYou know me too well, damn you\nWhy do I want to? I shouldn't want to\n\nH\u0435re you come again, and ther\u0435 you go\nNo coincidence, you always know\nWhen I'm movin' on, you move back in\nWith a half-ass, \"Sorry, how you been?\"\nWhy do you do it? Do you, just hate losin'?\nHere you come again, who could it be?\nIt's 3 a.m., no caller ID\n\nDon't you get tired of hurtin' me?\nI'm tired of hurtin' me\nI'm tired of hurtin' me\nSo I let it ring, I let it ring\n\nHere you come again, and there you go\nNo coincidence, you always know\nWhen I'm movin' on, you move back in\nKeep your half-ass, \"Sorry, how you been?\"\nI know why you do it, you just hate losin'\nHere you come again, who could it be?\nIt's just you, no caller ID\n\nIt's just you, no caller ID\nIt's just you, no caller ID"}
