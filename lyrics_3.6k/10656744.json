Would you tell no one?\nWould you pack a never-comin'-back-again bag?\nIf the three-times-four's bangin' at our door\nWould you stall and let me slip out the back?\nGirl, if you wanted to, could you get to runnin' to\nThat nev\u0435r-endin\u2019 honeymoon Mexico sun?\n\u2019Caus\u0435 you know I adore ya\nNo shit, I'd kill a man for ya\nAnd if I did, would you hide my gun?\nWould you hide my gun?\n\nIf you had to dig a hole, would you take it to the grave?\nPut some concrete shoes at the bottom of the lake?\nIf I shot him dead, would you shoot me straight?\nYeah, shoot me straight\n\nWould you hide my gun? Would you tell no one?\nWould you pack a never-comin\u2019-back-again bag?\nIf the three-times-four's bangin' at our door\nWould you stall and let me slip out the back?\nGirl, if you wanted to, could you get to runnin' to\nA never-endin\u2019 honeymoon Mexico sun?\n'Cause you know I adore ya\nNo shit, I'd kill a man for ya\nAnd if I did, would you hide my gun?\nWould you hide my gun?\n\nA big wheel gun in my right hand, tiny diamond in my left\nAre you down to go the distance, Lord, in sickness and in health?\nAin't nothin' gonna part us, not even death\n\nWould you hide my gun? Would you tell no one?\nWould you pack a never-comin'-back-again bag?\nIf the three-times-four's bangin' at our door\nWould you stall and let me slip out the back?\nGirl, if you wanted to, could you get to runnin' to\nThat never-endin' honeymoon Mexico sun?\n'Cause you know I adore ya\nNo shit, I'd kill a man for ya\nAnd if I did, would you hide my gun?\nWould you hide my gun?\n\nLord, I didn't do anything wrong\nI'm only askin' just because"}
