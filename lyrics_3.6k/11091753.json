(It's the king)\nYoung nigga trapped out, listenin' to Sno back in '03\nLearn to use the pot, I can microwave the whole ki'\nThey go Chopper City in Atlanta like it's B.G. (Brodie)\nKnew the pimp game from a pimp named OGD\nYou don't need to be on the scene to get a nigga blitzed\nPaid a dime for the Wock' lean, I ain't drinkin' Tris\nPourin' up that Quagen, sippin' on more syrup than Triple Six\nI got this shit on lock from Dubai back to the trench\nOh, yeah, Plutoski\n\nYeah\nRock bandanas like Santana in 2009\nDoin' my big one, sittin courtside\nSome pretty shit sittin' on each side\nUsed to serve on the East side\nHe ain't no gangster, he a CI\n\nBaby Tsunami, youngest in charge"}
