Now is your time\nRun when you hear that whistle blow\nAre you on my team or stuck on the sidelines\nWaiting for someone to tell you to go?\nFor someone to tell you to go\n\nYou should know I\n\nNeed someone to hold me close\nDeeper than I've ever known\nWhose love feels like a rodeo\nKnows just how to take control\nWhen I'm vulnerable\nHe's straight talking to my soul (If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah)\nConversation overload\n\n'Cause training season's over\n'Cause training season's over\nTraining season's over"}
