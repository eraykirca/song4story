Is it you?\nOr have they come to take me away?\nTo take me away\n\nOh, my, love is a lie\nShit my friends say to get me by\nIt hits different (It hits different)\nIt hits different this time\nCatastrophic blues\nMovin' on was always easy for me to do\nIt hits different (It hits different)\nIt hits different 'cause it's you\n\nOh, my, love is a lie\nShit my friends say to get me by\n'Cause it's you\nCatastrophic blues\nMovin' on was always easy for me to do\nIt hits different (Yeah)\nIt hits different 'cause it's you"}
