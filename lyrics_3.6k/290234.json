And\n\nI always feel like somebody's watchin' me\nAnd I have no privacy (Oh-oh-oh)\nI always feel like somebody's watchin' me\nTell me, is it just a dream?\n\nWhen I come home at night\nI bolt the door real tight\nPeople call me on the phone, I'm trying to avoid\nBut can the people on TV see me, or am I just paranoid?\nWhen I'm in the shower, I'm afraid to wash my hair\n'Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there\nPeople say I'm crazy, just a little touched\nBut maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much, that's why\n\nI always feel like somebody's watchin' me\nAnd I have no privacy (Oh-oh-oh)\nI always feel like somebody's watchin' me\nWho's playing tricks on me?\n\n(Who's watching me?) I don't know anymore\nAre the neighbors watching me? (Who's watching?)\nWell, is the mailman watching me? (Tell me, who's watching?)\nAnd I don't feel safe anymore, oh, what a mess\nI wonder who's watching me now (Who?), the IRS?\n\nI always feel like somebody's watchin' me\nAnd I have no privacy (Oh-oh-oh)\nI always feel like somebody's watchin' me\nTell me, is it just a dream?\nI always feel like somebody's watchin' me (Hee-hee-hee)\nAnd I have no privacy (Oh-oh-oh-oh)\nI always feel like somebody's watchin' me\nWho's playing tricks on me? (Who's watching?)\n\nOh-oh-oh\n(Who's watching me?)\nI always feel like somebody's watchin' me\nOoh, now, ah, ooh\nI always feel like somebody's watchin' me\n(Who's watching me?)\nI always feel like somebody's watchin' me\nOoh, now, ah, ooh\nI always feel like somebody's watchin' me\n(Who's watching me?)\n\nI always feel like somebody's watchin' me\nAnd I have no privacy (Oh-oh-oh-oh)\nI always feel like somebody's watchin' me\nI can't enjoy my tea (Who's watching me?)\nI always feel like somebody's watchin' me\nCan I have my privacy? (Oh-oh-oh)\nI always feel like somebody's watchin' me\nWho's watching me? (Who's watching me?)\nI always feel like somebody's watchin' me\nHee-hee, oh-oh-oh-oh\nI always feel like somebody's watchin' me\nStop playing tricks on me, yeah (Who's watching me?)\nI always feel like somebody's watchin' me\nWhy don't they leave me be? (Oh-oh-oh)\nI always feel like somebody's watchin' me\nI can't enjoy my tea (Who's watching me?)"}
