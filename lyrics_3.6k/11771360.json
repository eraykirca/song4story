I've been waiting 'round to die again\nWell, I saw all your friends and you weren't there\nAnd there's a picture of us holding up a pitcher of our favorite beer\nI'm tryna slow down this year, they can't hold it like I used to\n\nI ain't ever felt as lonely as I do tonight in this nice hotel\nTwelve hundred miles from that shit motel you kissed me softly in\nWell, I heard you been on the road, West Coast, just song singing\nAre you coming home again? 'Cause I'd like to see you smile\nIf you feel inclined, don't be dying on just anyone\n'Cause I'm the only one that gets to call you home\n\nAnd, oh, Madeline, how you been? I've been waiting 'round to die again\nIf you see her, won't you tell her I need her like a sailor needs the ocean\nOh, Madeline, how you been? Are you back with that boy again\nThat deserves a broken jaw?\nDoes he touch you like you need him to or come back when you call?\n\nWell, oh, Madeline, how you been? I've been waiting 'round to die again\nAnd I saw all your friends and you weren't there"}
