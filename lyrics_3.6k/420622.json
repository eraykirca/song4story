Yeah\n\nNo more tears\nNo more tears\nNo more tears\nNo more tears\n\nAnother day passes as the night closes in\nThe red light goes on to say it's time to begin\n\nI see the man around the corner waiting, can he see me?\nI close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here\n\nNo more tears\nNo more tears\nNo more tears\nNo more tears\n\nIt's just a sign of the times\nGoing forward in reverse\nStill, he who laughs last\nIs just a hand in the bush\nIn the bush\n\nSo now that it's over can't we just say goodbye? (Bye, bye, goodbye)\nI'd like to move on and make the most of the night\nMaybe a kiss before I leave you this way\nYour lips are so cold, I don't know what else to say\n\nI never wanted it to end this way, my love, my darling\nBelieve me when I say, \"To you, in love, I think I'm falling here\"\n\nNo more tears\nNo more tears\nNo more tears\nNo more tears\n\nIs just a hand in the bush"}
