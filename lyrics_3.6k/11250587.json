Is this a sign?\nShould I keep my mouth shut, let you live a lie?\n'Cause every day, it's a dog fight\nI can see it pilin' up like a mile high\n\n(Oh) 'Cause I hope that you know when you\u2019re broken, I\u2019m broken too\n(Oh) If you need me, I'll bleed for you\n\nEven if it kills me inside\nEven if you burn me alive\nI\u2019d carry that pain that you don't need\nI'd carry that weight that you don't see\nEven if it kills me this time\nEven if I\u2019m buried alive\nI'd give my last breath so you could breathe\n\nEven if it kills me\nEven if it kills me\n\nIs this the moment? Is this the time?\nAre you gonna wake up, gonna realize\nYour world is burnin'? Thousand signs\nBut you're choking on the smoke from the other side\n\n(Oh) And I hope that you know when you're broken, I'm broken too\n(Oh) If you need me, I'll bleed for you\n\nEven if it kills me inside\nEven if you burn me alive\nI'd carry that pain that you don't need\nI'd carry that weight that you don't see\nEven if it kills me this time\nEven if I'm buried alive\nI'd give my last breath so you could breathe\nEven if it kills me\n\nRunnin' from the past, runnin' from the pain\nYou can't run it back if you can't get away\nR-r-runnin' from the past, runnin' from the pain\nYou can't run it back if you can't get a\u2014\nWarning!\n\nI won't run, I won't hide\nStandin' in the fire, I'm alive\nI won't run, I won't hide\nI'm not leavin' you behind\n\nEven if it kills me inside\nEven if you burn me alive\nI'd carry that pain that you don't need\nI'd carry that weight that you don't see\nEven if it kills me this time\nEven if I'm buried alive\nI'd give my last breath so you could breathe\n\nEven if it kills me\nEven if it kills me\nEven if it kills me\n\nI won't run, I won't hide\nI'm not leavin' you behind"}
