(Not yet)\nDid you forg\u0435t we're tight on time?\n\nR\u0435achin' out on my way home\nYou can be so cold, I'll try again\nYou make me sad and second-guess myself\nYou can be so cold, Midwest Indigo\n\nCloud coverage matched my outfit to a knife\nI requested counsel with the counselor and he cancelled twice\nIt's a different blue, it's deeper than it's been\nI'll be pulling into the parking lot before the heat kicks in\nWhat's your ETA? (Two minutes)\nChill out, man, we're right on time\n\nReachin' out on my way home\nYou can be so cold, I'll try again\nYou make me sad and second-guess myself\nYou can be so cold, Midwest Indigo\n\nAnd I want love and sunny days\nI'm a bit too old to run away\nYou make me sad and second-guess myself\nYou can be so cold\nYou can be so cold\nMidwest Indigo"}
