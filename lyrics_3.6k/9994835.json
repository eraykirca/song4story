(Pretty bird)\nAre you just watching and waiting for spring? (Watching, waiting)\nOr do you have some kind of magic to bring? (Pretty bird)\nAre you just watching and waiting for spring?\nOr do you have some kind of magic?\n\nCardinal\nAre you bringing me a message from the other side?\nCardinal\nAre you telling me I'm on somebody's mind?\nCardinal\nAre you bringing me a message from the other side?\nCardinal\nAre you telling me I'm on somebody's mind?\nAre you bringing me a message from the other side?\nCardinal"}
