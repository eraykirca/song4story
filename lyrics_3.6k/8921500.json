I'm done\nYou miss me? No duh\nWhere I'm at, I'm up where I'm at\nYou want me? I'm done (I'm done)\nYou miss me? No duh (No duh)\nWhere I'm at, I'm up (I'm up) where I'm at\n\nYou want me? I'm done\n(I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind)\nYou miss me? No duh\nWhere I'm at, I'm up where I'm at\n(Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather)\nYou want me? I'm done\n(I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind)\nYou miss me? No duh\nWhere I'm at, I'm up where I'm at\n(Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather, yeah)"}
