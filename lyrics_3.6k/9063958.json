Whew\nA couple karats in my ears enough karats for me\nI'm feelin' like the local scene finally cherishing me\nSelling out my hometown so my parents can see\nCharismatic, naive, young, arrogant teen\nGivin' everything I got to the American dream\nBut I'm still playing 1 PM sets at the festivals\nLooking at the crowd, they embarrassed for me, jeez\n\nAmbitious twenty-four-year-old\nUsed to have dreams of being friends with my heroes\nNow I'm Andrea Pirlo out in Europe spending euros\nFrench girl chewin' on my earlobe\nHere goes nothing, coasting through customs\nTake away the phones at afterparties, we don't trust 'em\nHeartthrob status, I've adjusted to the lustin'\nFaceTime calls about God from Justin\n\"I can't stop hustlin', I can't stop hustlin'\"\nI'm tryna be inspired, but y'all ain't got nothin'\nThey tryna downplay me now, ain't that somethin'?\nI saw that comin'\nReadin' way too many articles about myself, I gotta fall back from it\nAuditioned for a lead and got the call back from it\nI'm festival headlinin', keepin' them heads noddin'\nI tell her I'll be back, but I don't know when the next time is\nFolks think it's 'bout to be more actin' and less rhymin'\nBut hell nah, I gotta show these boys who the best out is"}
