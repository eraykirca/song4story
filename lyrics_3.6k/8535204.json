Everything could be (Yeah)\nI wrote rules the wrong ways, had blues and long days\nHad clues to dead ends, I'd lose then lost faith\nI bruised up my face, she kissed, they go away\nMy wrist I made work, I kept my pay first, like (Cool)\n\nI hold my head, she sings to me\nI grow, forget her in my work\nThose times we shared, they're yours alone\nAnd when I'm dead, we'll all go home\nThey'll cry, they'll sing, then leave this place\nThis place to me was everything\nWhat hurts, what stings, I saw her in\nThe garden with her friends, she said\n\nI will find out, I will\nWake up, find out, I will\n\nThink fast, you only get one try\nSleep tight, I wanna get sunshine\nWake up, you know we got things to see\nShe talks and nothing makes sense to me"}
