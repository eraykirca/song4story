Need a lifeline right now\nNinety-nine nights, tryna get my mind right now\nLife is sour, even when I'm in the limelight now\nBut I try somehow\n\nWhen I'm alone, pretend I'm letting you go\nJust tell me who to blame for this\nWhen wakin' up, feels like a punch in the gut\nJust tell me, who's to blame for this?\n\n(Ta-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da)\nJust tell me, who's to blame for this?\n(Ta-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da)\nJust tell me, who's to blame for this?\n(Ta-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da)\nJust tell me, who's\u2014?\n(Ta-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da\nTa-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da\nTa-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da\nTa-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da, ta-da-da-da)"}
