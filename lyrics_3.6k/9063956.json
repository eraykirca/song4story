'Cause it can't be\u2014\n\"Yes, our Marcus\"\n\"The same Marcus we collected Pok\u00e9mon cards with\"\nThe one with perfect grades that has family in New Orleans?\n\"Yes, that Marcus, he's got seven rape charges\"\n\nRide for my dawgs, lie for my dawgs, die for my dawgs\nRide for my dawgs, lie for my dawgs, die for my dawgs\nBecause it's\u2014 (Gang, gang, gang)\n(Gang, gang, gang)\n(Gang)\nBecause it's\u2014 (Gang, gang, gang)\n(Gang, gang, gang)\n(Gang, oh)\n\nHome for the holidays\nMy friend pulled me to the side like, \"Did you hear about Kevin?\"\nKevin who? \"Our Kevin\"\nWhat happened? \"He got arrested\"\n\"They found a bunch of messages he sent to lil' kids\"\n\"And apparently, he met up with this ten year old and the now the kid's sayin' he got molested\"\nMolested by who? \"By Kevin\"\nNah, it's gotta be a different Kevin\n\"Look, I'm tellin' you it's Kevin, that we've known since we were seven\"\n\"The one whose dad's a reverend\"\n\"The same Kevin we spend every weekend with and call brethren\"\n\nRide for my dawgs, lie for my dawgs, die for my dawgs\nRide for my dawgs, lie for my dawgs, die for my dawgs\nBecause it's\u2014 (Gang, gang, gang)\n(Gang, gang, gang)\n(Gang)\nBecause it's\u2014 (Gang, gang, gang)\n(Gang, gang, gang)\n(Gang, oh)\n\nTruthfully, it's family 'til it can't be, gang 'til it ain't\nTwins, but it depends, brothers until somethin' is uncovered\nDawgs until the lifting of the fog\n\"I always got you,\" turns into \"Well, I never thought you\"\nYears of camaraderie suddenly disappear\nAlmost like you never were here\nUnconditional love becomes very conditioned when push comes to shove\nAnd all that talk of takin' bullets suddenly feels foolish\nPictures with him turn to ad campaigns, you gotta pull it\nFeet held to the fire\nWe hold accountable the ones we hold dear out of morals, but mainly fear\nThe choice becomes clear\nAnd years of camaraderie suddenly disappear\nAlmost like you never were here\n\nAlmost like you never were here"}
