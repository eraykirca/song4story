buckles and clout, overzealous if prone to violence\nMake the wrong turn, be it will or the wheel alignment\nResidue burned, mist of the inner-city\nMiscommunication to keep homi' detective busy\nNo protection is risky\nDesensitized, I vandalized pain, covered up and camouflaged\nGet used to hearin' arsenal rain\nAnalyze, risk your life, take the charge\nHomies done fucked your baby mama once you hit the yard\nThat's culture\nTwenty-three hour lockdown, then somebody called\nSaid your lil' nephew was shot down, the culture's involved\nI done seen niggas do seventeen, hit the halfway house\nGet out and get his brains blown out, lookin' to buy some weed\nCar wash is played out, new GoFundMe accounts'll proceed\nA brand-new victim'll shatter those dreams\nThe culture\n\n(I want, I want, I want, I want)\nBut I want you to want me too (I want, I want, I want, I want)\nI want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)\nI want the hood\nLook what I done for you (Look what I done for you)\nLook what I done for you\n\nI said I do this for my culture\nTo let y'all know what a nigga look like in a bulletproof Rover\nIn my mama's sofa was a doo-doo popper\nHair trigger, walk up closer, ain't no Photoshoppin'\nFriends bipolar, grab you by your pockets\nNo option if you froze up, always play the offense\nNiggas goin' to work and sellin' work, late for work\nWorkin' late, prayin' for work, but he on paperwork\nThat's the culture, point the finger, promote ya\nRemote location, witness protection, they gon' hold ya\nThe streets got me fucked up, y'all can miss me\nI wanna represent for us\nNew revolution was up and movin'\nI'm in Argentina wiping my tears, full of confusion\nWater in between us, another peer's been executed\nHistory repeats again\nMake amends, then find a nigga with the same skin to do it\nBut that's the culture, crack a bottle\nHard to deal with the pain when you're sober\nBy tomorrow, we forget the remains, we start over\nThat's the problem\nOur foundation was trained to accept whatever follows\nDehumanized, insensitive\nScrutinize the way we live for you and I\nEnemies shook my hand, I can promise I'll meet you\nIn the land where no equal is your equal\nNever say I ain't told ya, nah\nIn the land where hurt people hurt more people\nFuck callin' it culture\n\n(I want, I want, I want, I want)\nBut I want you to want me too (I want, I want, I want, I want)\nI want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)\nI want the hood\nLook what I done for you (Look what I done for you)\nLook what I done for you\n\nTake the drums out\n\nCelebrate new life when it come back around\nThe purpose is in the lessons we learnin' now\nSacrifice personal gain over everything\nJust to see the next generation better than ours\nI wasn't perfect, the skin I was in had truly suffered\nTemptation, impatience, everything that the body nurtures\nI felt the good, I felt the bad, and I felt the worry\nBut all-in-all, my productivity had stayed urgent\nFace your fears, always knew that I would make it here\nWhere the energy is magnified and persevered\nConsciousness is synchronized and crystal-clear\nEuphoria is glorified and made His\nReflectin' on my life and what I done\nPaid dues, made rules, change outta love\nThem same views made schools change curriculums\nBut didn't change me starin' down the barrel of the gun\nShould I feel resentful I didn't see my full potential?\nShould I feel regret about the good that I was into?\nEverything is everything, this ain't coincidental\nI woke up that morning with more heart to give you\nAs I bleed through the speakers, feel my presence\nTo my brother, to my kids, I'm in Heaven\nTo my mother, to my sis, I'm in Heaven\nTo my father, to my wife, I am serious, this is Heaven\nTo my friends, make sure you countin' them blessings\nTo my fans, make sure you make them investments\nAnd to the killer that sped up my demise\nI forgive you, just know your soul's in question\nI seen the pain in your pupil when that trigger had squeezed\nAnd though you did me gruesome, I was surely relieved\nI completed my mission, wasn't ready to leave\nBut fulfilled my days, my Creator was pleased\nI can't stress how I love y'all\nI don't need to be in flesh just to hug y'all\nThe memories recollect just because y'all\nCelebrate me with respect\nThe unity we protect is above all\nAnd Sam, I'll be watchin' over you\nMake sure my kids watch all my interviews\nMake sure you live out our dreams we produced\nKeep that genius in your brain on the move\nAnd to my neighborhood, let the good prevail\nMake sure them babies and the leaders outta jail\nLook for salvation when troubles get real\n'Cause you can't help the world until you help yourself\nAnd I can't blame the hood the day that I was killed\nY'all had to see it, that's the only way to feel\nAnd though my physical won't reap the benefits\nThe energy that carry on emits still\nI want you"}
