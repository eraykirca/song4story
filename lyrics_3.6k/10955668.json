Oh, how?\n\nBaby, I tried to (Tried to) call you (Call you)\nOff like a bad habit (Yeah)\nTried to (Tried to) call you (Call you)\nOff like a bad habit\n\nBut I keep comin' back (Oh no) like a revolvin' door (Yeah)\nSay I couldn't want you less, but I just want you more\nBut I keep comin' back (Oh no) like a revolvin' door (Yeah)\nSay I couldn't want you less, but I just want you more\n\nAnd more (Can't get what I want), and more (Can't get enough of)\nAnd more (You, when you make me), more (More)\nAnd more (Can't get what I want), and more (Can't get enough of)\nAnd more (You, when you make me), more (More)\n\nChange my mind so much I can't find it\nI work so much, can't be reminded\nLife feels worse, but good with you in it\nSupposed to be on stage, but fuck it, I need a minute\nChange my mind so much it's exhaustin'\nI still think 'bout that night out in Boston\nI'm more hurt than I would admit\nI'm supposed to be an adult, but fuck it, I need a minute (Oh)\n\nI need a minute, I need a minute (Ooh)\nI need a, I need, fuck it, I need a minute (I need a)\nI need a minute, I need a minute (Yeah)\nI need a, I need, fuck it, I need a minute\n\nI need a minute\nOoh, I need a minute\nMm\nMm"}
