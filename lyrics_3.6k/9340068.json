You're not the only one\n\nI know it sounds fatal, I know we made fires\nThe ending's real clear and it won't take us higher\nTonight, I might need to come kamikaze\nCrash into your way (Kamikaze, kamikaze)\nI love the beginnin', the moonlight is callin'\nI know we'll go up, but we'll end up freefallin'\nYou mind if I need to come kamikaze?\nCrash into your way (Kamikaze)\n\nCrash into your way, way, way\n\nYou kiss me on the cheek and\nWe say hello like it's goodbye\nI should've called that\nBut I still feel the heat like\nA secret kind of language\nWhen your fingers fall down my back (Mm)\n\nTell me, ooh\nAre you tired of bein' alone? You're not the only one\n\nI know it sounds fatal, I know we made fires\nThe ending's real clear and it won't take us higher\nTonight, I might need to come kamikaze\nCrash into your way (Kamikaze, kamikaze)\nI love the beginnin', the moonlight is callin'\nI know we'll go up, but we'll end up freefallin' (I know we'll go up but we'll end up freefallin')\nYou mind if I need to come kamikaze?\nCrash into your way (Kamikaze)\n\nCrash into your way, way, way\nTonight, I need to come crash into your way, way, way\nCrash into your way\n(Kamikaze)"}
