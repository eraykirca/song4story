No!\nHe'll say to me, \"I see who you truly are\nA girl on whom I can rely\"\nAnd that's how we'll begin\nThe Wizard and I\nOnce I'm with the Wizard\nMy whole life will change\n'Cause once you're with the Wizard\nNo one thinks you're strange\nNo father is not proud of you\nNo sister acts ashamed\nAnd all of Oz has to love you\nWhen, by the Wizard, you're acclaimed\nAnd this gift or this curse I have inside\nMaybe, at last, I'll know why\nAs we work hand in hand\nThe Wizard and I\n\nAnd one day, he'll say to me, \"Elphaba\nA girl who is so superior\nShouldn't a girl who's so good inside\nHave a matching exterior?\nAnd since folks here to an absurd degree\nSeem fixated on your verdigris\nWould it be alright by you\nIf I de-greenify you?\"\nAnd though, of course, that's not important to me\n\"Alright, why not?\", I'll reply\nOh, what a pair we'll be\nThe Wizard and I\nYes, what a pair we'll be\nThe Wizard and\u2014\nUnlimited\nMy future is unlimited\nAnd I've just had a vision, almost like a prophecy\nI know it sounds truly crazy\nAnd true, the vision's hazy\nBut I swear, someday, there'll be\nA celebration throughout Oz\nThat's all to do with me\nAnd I'll stand there with the Wizard\nFeeling the things I've never felt\nAnd though I'd never show it\nI'd be so happy I could melt\nAnd so it will be for the rest of my life\nAnd I'll want nothing else 'til I die\nHeld in such high esteem\nWhen people see me, they will scream\nFor half of Oz's favorite team\nThe Wizard and I"}
