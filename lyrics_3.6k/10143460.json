Who says so?\nNow it turns out that I live in spite\nAnd I've got you tucked in my chest, baby\nWho says so? Who says so?\n\nEy\nTell the person who's informing you (Huh?)\nThat they're badly informed, that they should inform you better (Maluma, baby)\n\nNow I have a new ass that gets all the merits\nShe's with me 'cause she wants to, you were there for the credit card\nLeave that pathetic phony, I'm calm in Mexico\nFor that shit that you're talking, I bought you toilet paper\nWho the fuck told you that I'd still cry for you?\nNot even if you were a gold coin\nSo stupid, I gave you everything\nAnd you just cheated on me\n\nAnd now they say they saw me screaming your name\nDrunk in some bar, I don't know where, baby\nWho says so? Who says so?\nAh, now it turns out that I live in spite\nAnd I've got you tucked in my chest, baby\nWho says so? Who says so?\n\nAyy\nTell the person who's informing you\nThat they're badly informed, that they should inform you better"}
