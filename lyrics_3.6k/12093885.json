(Oh)\n\nOpen\nDarling, open up your window\nTake my, and take my hand 'cause it ain't nowhere we can't go\nYou and I, leave it all behind\nStarin' in your eyes, between your thighs 'til the sun shines\n\nIf I could be there\nI would love you inside out\nIf I could be there\nCan you let me in right now?\nNow that we here\nI would love you inside out\nLet me be clear\nCan you let me in right now? (Clear)"}
