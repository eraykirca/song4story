Oh\nOoh, or were we just wasting time?\n'Cause we were hurting\nBut I know that you know that I know you best\nAnd I know that we both can forget all the rest\nIf we just can\nAdmit that\n\nWe both were so difficult, but so invincible\nIrresistible, but I loved you still\nYou kept my secrets and stole my weaknesses\nIn your white T-shirt, but I couldn't fill\nThe shoes you laid down for me from the ones that came before\nI was all the way in, you were halfway out the door\nOh, I was an animal making my way up the hill\nAnd you were going in for the kill\n\nOh, I was going in for the kill\nOh, we were going in for the kill"}
