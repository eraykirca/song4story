Like, how hard can it be?\nYou know I showed you them songs you been playing all on repeat\nYou found replacements for me, but you know it's hard to compete\nWoah\nCalling me daddy, I taught you things that a father can't teach\nAt the beginning, it felt like you're going harder than me\nThen you stepped back on this shit, girl, you hit the Harden on me\n\nWoah, woah, woah, woah\nWoah, woah"}
