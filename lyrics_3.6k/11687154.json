I'd rather write my songs\nExcuse me, master, I think you're confused\nI was promised forty acres and mules\nDamn, I feel like a fool, forget the rules, what the fine print say?\nMy great-great grandaddy probably turn in his grave\nIf he knew I was a slave to the state\nGo tell him I ain't afraid of ghosts, vampires, whips, and chains\nCrazy contracts, snitches, and hangs\nShit, it all be the same\nMoney, sex, cigarettes, champagne\nWeed, X, cocaine to the brain\nStay afloat, maintain, so much came with the fortune and fame\nWould drive a young, humble nigga insane\nDevil ridin' this back like the tires on this new Cadillac\nAnd I waited my turn for this\nI lived and I learned for this (Yeah)\nHow I stayed down\nWalked so many miles, so many miles, so many miles\n\nI'm not scared of werewolves, vampires\nBut man, I'd always lose sleep (Always lose sleep)\nWhen I dream\nThat I could set my people free (My people free)\nThat I could set my people free (Oh, woah)\nI'm not scared of werewolves, vampires\nBut man, I'd always lose sleep\nWhen I dream\nThat I could set my people free (Woah, woah)\nThat I could set my people free, yeah, yeah\nI could set my people free\n\nIf I could set my people free\nIf I could set my people free\nOh, oh-oh\nSet my people free (Woah)\n(Who is Wonderyo?)\n(Ayo, Cuhly, go on)\nLet my people free\nI'll never be free"}
