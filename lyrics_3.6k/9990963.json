I don't know\nThen I had this interaction I've been thinkin' 'bout for like five weeks\nWonder if he's thinkin' 'bout it too and smiling\nWonder if he knows that that's been what's inspirin' me\nWonder if he's judgin' me like I am right now\n\nI don't care\nI'd rather tell the truth (Truth)\nThan make it worse for you, mm (You)\n\nIf the sun refused to shine\nBaby, would I still be your lover?\nWould you want me there?\nIf the moon went dark tonight\nAnd if it all ended tomorrow\nWould I be the one on your mind, your mind, your mind?\nAnd if it all ended tomorrow\nWould you be the one on mine?"}
