Oh!)\nWe're making pennies out of paper, better find a new slime\n\nMe and the boys in the hotel lobby\nMe and the boys in the hotel lobby\nMe and the boys in the hotel lobby\n\nIs there something wrong with the way that I'm designed?\nCan't find comfort in anything, yeah\nShould I change, should I leave myself behind?\nAnd buy a boat to a private island\nBaby girl (Girl), won't you dry your eyes? (Dry your eyes)\nDon't stress because you're doing it right (Doing it right)\nWhat they say, anything at all\nDon't need a thing because you're in control\n\nI can be yellow (Yellow), I can rearrange by the afternoon\nAnd I'm purple (Purple), so quick when I switch it up\nHurtful to mellow (Mellow)\nI can be anything I wanted to, any color of the rainbow (Rainbow)\nYeah, me and the boys in the hotel lobby\n\nLow tide, moon's so bright\nMoving my hips from left to right\nMy, my check my phone\nFeel it in my belly when you're driving home like\nLow tide, moon's so bright\nMoving my hips from left to right\nMy, my check my phone\nFeel it in my belly when you're driving home like\n\nLike Cinderella making babies on the company's dime\n(Oh! Oh!)\nWe're making pennies out of paper, better find a new slime\n\nMe and the boys in the hotel lobby\nMe and the boys in the hotel lobby\nMe and the boys in the hotel lobby\nMe and the boys in the hotel lobby\nMe and the boys in the hotel lobby\nMe and the boys in the hotel lobby\nMe and the boys in the hotel lobby\nMe and the boys in the hotel lobby\nMe and the boys in the hotel lobby\nMe and the boys in the hotel lobby"}
