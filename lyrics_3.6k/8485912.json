Oh\nDid you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh\nWhen she said it was too much?\nDo you wish you could still touch her?\nIt's just a question\n\nHalf-moon eyes, bad surprise\nDid you realize out of time?\nShe was on your mind with some dickhead guy\nThat you saw that night\nBut you were on somethin'\nIt was one drink after another\nFuckin' politics and gender roles\nAnd you're not sure and I don't know\nGot swept away in the gray\nI just may like to have a conversation\n\nCan I ask you a question?\nDid you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room\nAnd every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you\nBut fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?\nThen what did you do?\nDid you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh\nDid you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh\nWhen she said it was too much?\nDo you wish you could still touch her?\nIt's just a question\n\nDoes it feel like everything's just like\nSecond best after that meteor strike?\nAnd what's that that I heard? That you're still with her?\nThat's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable\nAnd right, but tonight\n\nCan I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?)\nDid you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room (In a crowded room)\nAnd every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you (Makin' fun of you)\nBut fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?\nThen what did you do? (Do)\nDid you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh\nDid you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh (More of a fight)\nWhen she said it was too much?\nDo you wish you could still touch her?\nIt's just a question"}
