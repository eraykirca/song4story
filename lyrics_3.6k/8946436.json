(Nymph, then a virgin, nurse, then a servant)\nFor somebody I thought was my saviour (Just an appendage, live to attend him)\nYou sure make me do a whole lot of labour (So that he never lifts a finger)\nThe calloused skin on my hands is cracking (24/7 baby machine)\nSo if our love ends, would that be a bad thing? (So he can live out his picket-fence dreams)\nAnd the silence haunts our bed chamber (It's not an act of love if you make her)\nYou make me do too much labour"}
