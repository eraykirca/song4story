(How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)\nOh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill\nCan't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will\nWent for me and not her\n'Cause girls your age know better\n\nI've made some real big mistakes\nBut you make the worst one look fine\nI should've known it was strange\nYou only come out at night\nI used to think I was smart\nBut you made me look so naive\nThe way you sold me for parts\nAs you sunk your teeth into me, oh\nBloodsucker, fame fucker\nBleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire\n(Ah)\nYou said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?\nYou can't love anyone 'cause that would mean you had a heart\nI tried to help you out, now I know that I can't\n'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand\n\nI've made some real big mistakes\nBut you make the worst one look fine\nI should've known it was strange\nYou only come out at night\nI used to think I was smart\nBut you made me look so naive\nThe way you sold me for parts\nAs you sunk your teeth into me, oh\nBloodsucker, fame fucker\nBleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire"}
