(I know that)\nBut what am I closer to? (We'll be looking back one day)\nWhat am I closer to? (I hope that we)\nWhat am I closer to? (Will never be the same)\n\nI know that\nWe'll be looking back one day\nBut I trust that I (I trust that I)\nI could never stay the same (I could never stay the same)\nWhen everything felt so wrong\nIt led me to where I belong\nSo now (Now, now)\nI'm going home\nTake me home, just take me home\nTake me home\n\nHome is a symphony and it's bittersweet when it's callin' me\nJust another river deep, flowing to an ocean\nI know that I may never know; the future, unpredictable\nA hundred choices led me here, lessons learned with every tear\n\nThey take me home, take me home\nTake me home, take me home\nI hold it inside my heart\nJust take me home"}
