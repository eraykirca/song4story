That's what I get exhausted thinkin'\nCan't be ungrateful 'bout this life, you know we fought to see it\nI'd rather you hate me while I'm here than love me when I'm dead\nThey sent that text that Twinnem checked, couldn't stomach what I read\nLike life been pushin' me too far and I'm stuck on the edge\nDon't wanna party, I'll stay in this lonely room instead\nAnd I'm just\u2014\n\nBarely holdin' on\nThis life gets scary as it goes on\nBurdens while we carry on\nI ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong\nHope my secrets get buried when I'm gone\nStarin' at the writin' on these headstones\nThey keep on tryna tear me, but I'm strong\nThat's what you wanted to tell me all along\n\nDeath in the air, that shit'll leave you with a chilled spine\nEven though my spirits down, like, I'm okay, I feel fine\nShots from that steel nine, ain\u2019t from that hillside\nI'm from the trenches where they murder just to kill time\nA heavy heart, eyes rollin', through dark times, soulless\nSorry that they took your son, I'm sendin' my condolence\nGotta face the facts when the truth unfoldin'\nI hope you know this\nThat I'm just\u2014\n\nBarely holdin' on\nThis life gets scary as it goes on\nBurdens while we carry on\nI ain't perfect, spare me if I'm wrong\nHope my secrets get buried when I'm gone\nStarin' at the writin' on these headstones\nThey keep on tryna tear me, but I'm strong\nThat's what you wanted to tell me all along\n\nOoh, there's a power in your soul\nOoh, and I wanted you to know"}
