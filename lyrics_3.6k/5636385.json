(Crush 'em down)\nIf pills can turn to powder\nThen this world could turn to ash\nEverything seems so slow\nBut my past, I thought that it would last longer\nI just thought that, thought that, thought that\nThis feelin', this feelin' would last longer, yeah\n\nOoh, ooh, ooh\nOoh, ooh, ooh\n\nYeah\nYeah, somebody gave me a treasure map\nNowhere on that motherfucker say where the X is at\nAnd I don't wanna see the whole world through a telecast\nBeen waitin' my whole life, I finally thought I should tell you that, yeah\nStarted smokin' weed again, started tryna read again\nClean myself up, now would you be my friend?\nDo I need to know the beginning to see the end?\nWhat's the difference 'tween the truth and things that we pretend?\nI lie awake faded, watch the days go by\nAnd only at the lows do I chase that high\nFear God, stay humble\nOriginal sin, we all come from the same struggle\n\nWhat ya gonna do when the money comin' slow?\nWhat ya gonna do when the money comin' slow?\nWhat ya gonna do when the money comin' slow\nAnd you left out on your own?\nWhat ya gonna do when the money comin' slow?\nWhat ya gonna do when the money comin' slow?\nWhat ya gonna do when the money comin' slow\nAnd you left out in the cold? Woah\nCan I get four Norcos, two Oxys, two Roxys, three methadone\nCouple Percocets, some heroin, two Xanax bars and six-ounces of that lean?\nThank you\nDo when the money comin' slow?\nWhat ya gonna do when the money comin' slow? (Slow)\nWhat ya gonna do when the money comin' slow? (Slow)\nWhat ya gonna do when the money comin' slow?\nWhat ya gonna do when the money comin' slow? (Slow)\nWoah-oh, woah-oh\nWhat ya gonna do?"}
