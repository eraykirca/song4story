K Swiss and polo down\nAnd Mama had to put a down payment by herself and ain't nobody even try to help\nShe went to jail and shit went left, and I was left\nI did my best, I needed rest, I got arrested\nEverybody looking at me like I'm not invested\nBitch, you know how hard I was stressing?\nPlease, don't call me with weekend plans\nI'm ripping out all my hair\nAnd bitch, I don't even dance\nBut sometimes I like to (Juk, juk, juk, juk, juk, juk)\n(I like to juk, juk, juk, juk, juk, juk, juk)\nI like to juk, juk-juk, juk, juk-juk\nJuk, and juk, and juk, and juk and juk and\nJuk, and juk, and juk, and juk\nI be looking through the\u2014\n\nPhoto album but the color faded from it\nIf I could go back and tell you how it ends, I woulda done it\nDon't look down\nDon't look down"}
