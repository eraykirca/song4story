I wanna hit the road with you\nCheckin' your location, I'm wishin' I was close to you\nI left my heart on the West End, I can't wait to get home to you\nHome to you\nI left my heart on the West End, can't wait to get home to you\nHome to you\nOh, woah\nOh, woah\nI left my heart on the West End, can't wait to get home to you\nHome to you\nOh, woah\nOh, woah\n\nOh, oh (I'm wishin' I was close to you)\nHow you feel about a tour bus? I wanna hit the road with you\nAnd I been checkin' your location, wishin' I was close to you\nLeft my heart on the West End (I wanna hit the road with you)\nLeft my heart on the West End, wishin' I was home with you (Home with you)\nOh, woah\nGrrah"}
