(Ah-ah)\nI need something that'll make me believe (Ah-ah)\nIf you got it, baby, give it to me\n\nThey say I come and I go\nTell me all the ways you need me\nI'm not here for long\nCatch me or I go Houdini\nI come and I go (I come and I go)\nProve you got the right to please me\nEverybody knows (I'm not here for long)\nCatch me or I go Houdini\n\nIf you're good enough, you'll find the way\nMaybe you could cause a girl to change (Her ways)\nDo you think about it night and day?\nMaybe you could be the one to make me stay\n\nOh-oh\nOoh\n\nI come and I go\nTell me all the ways you need me (Ooh)\nI'm not here for long\nCatch me or I go Houdini\nI come and I go (I come and I go)\nProve you got the right to please me\nEverybody knows (I'm not here for long)\nCatch me or I go Houdini\n\nHoudini (Ah)\nCatch me or I go Houdini"}
