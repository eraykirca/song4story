Redemption song\nLuckenbach, home sweet home\nI'm where I belong\nAin't nothing wrong with\nWe ain\u2019t as young as we use to be\nBut young at heart is so easy\nWhen you let some loud guitars and words that rhyme\nHandle the hands of time\n\nHands of time\n\nTryna hang on as the song rolls\nLike gravity pulls on the grains of sand\nWe take our licks, life takes its toll\nWe say thanks and we fold our hands\nAnd it's\n\nAmazing Grace, how sweet the sound\nSunday morning coming down\nTuesday's gone, green grass of home (Tuesday's gone)\nI come to the garden alone, yeah (Oh, oh)\nWe ain\u2019t as young as we used to be\nBut until under that willow, you bury me\nI'm gonna turn up some loud guitars\n\nTurn up some loud guitars\nTurn up some loud guitars\nCrank some loud guitars\nCrank up some loud guitars\nWanna hear some loud guitars\nGonna let some loud guitars and words that rhyme\nHandle the hands of time"}
