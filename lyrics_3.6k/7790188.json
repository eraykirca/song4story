I'm losing count\nSince June 22nd\nMy heart's been on fire\nI've been spendin' my nights in the rain tryin' to put it out\n\nSo I'm snappin' one, two\nWhere are you?\nYou're still in my heart\nSnappin' three, four\nDon't need you here anymore\nGet out of my heart\n'Cause I might snap\n\nOh-woah\n'Cause I might snap\nOh-woah\n\nAnd if one more person says, \"You should get over it\"\nOh, I might stop talkin' to people before I snap, snap, snap\nOh, I might stop talkin' to people before I snap\n\nSnappin' one, two\nWhere are you? (Where are you?)\nYou're still in my heart (Still in my heart)\nSnappin' three, four\nDon't need you here anymore (Need you here anymore)\nGet out of my heart\n\n'Cause I might sna\u2014, I might snap (Oh-woah)\n'Cause I might sna\u2014, I might snap (Oh-woah)\nGet out of my heart, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, heart (Oh-woah)\n'Cause I might snap (Oh-woah)\nGet out of my heart, yeah\n'Cause I might snap"}
