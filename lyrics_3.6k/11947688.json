Oh, uh\n\nI'll tell you this, my love\nI do not give a fuck\nI want you on your worst behavior\nTouch me like a gangster\nRide me, baby boy, give it hell\nThis bed ain't gon' break itself\n\nThis bed ain't gonna break itself\nThis bed ain't gonna break itself\nThis bed ain't gonna break itself\n\nYou look like you like whips and chains, won't you do something insane, baby?\nI want that strange, what's that hidden in your brain, baby?\nLock that door, want that on the floor\nHow far we gon' go? Oh, uh\n\nI'll tell you this, my love\nI do not give a fuck\nI want you on your worst behavior\nTouch me like a gangster\nRide me, baby boy, give it hell\nThis bed ain't gon' break itself\n\nThis bed ain't gonna break itself\nThis bed ain't gonna break itself\nThis bed ain't gon' break itself, no\nThis bed ain't gonna break itself\nThis bed ain't gon' break itself\n\nThis bed ain't gonna break itself\nThis bed ain't gonna break itself\nThis bed ain't gonna break itself\nThis bed ain't gon' break itself"}
