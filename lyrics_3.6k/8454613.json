You ain't turnt, come get with Baby'nem\nYou supposed to be with us, but you switched up, you gotta stay with them\nI ran up a dub in just two months, told you, \"Don't play with him\"\nThis shit gettin' crazy\nI'm workin' double time, this summer mine, I'm not just sayin' this\nWe did too much to just be gang, I really treat him like family\nI'm not a fraud, I make a lot of noise, that's why they can't stand me\nYou piss me off, we goin' to war and I ain't got no understandin'\nWaterfall flow 'cause I just keep flowin', yeah\nShe told me she comin', so I keep goin', oh yeah\nReally tryna win? You gotta sacrifice\nBro'nem was gettin' rich, I felt I had to try it\nI took a little piece and went and maximized it\nI took my little fans I had and amplified 'em\nThis shit don't come free but you can't go and buy it\nAin't into the clout but I stay goin' viral\nYou ain't really down then you can't come around us\nForever with the ones that I'ma do or die with\n\nPhantom doors came suicide, used to have to catch a ride\nI ain't tryna go too deep, maybe we can catch a vibe\nMaybe we can slide, dependin' on what your plans like\nI might play it quiet but you know that I'm the man, right?\nYou gon' have to pick a side, come here, let me pick your mind\nYou can tell me all your flaws, I'll get someone to fix your body\nShe love when I thug and like when I get romantic\nShe wanna be gang, I got her doin' our handshake\n\nI been doin' all of this shit from the top of my head\nIf you're ready to cross the line then I ain't gon' stop you, go ahead\nBut I just hope that you're prepared, I been accepted life ain't fair\nWe used to ship from here and there, my mama done had to sign for mail\nNever let a ho play with my heart, I went through that in jail\nCan't believe I gotta put that fire on bro, we been through hell\nYou ain't gangster, I know damn well if they catch you, you gon' tell\nI ain't have no help, I made everybody happy by myself\nBut I did have a plug and my fans though\nKnow they want me to lay down but I got somethin' to stand for\nThis shit in me, it ain't on me, I can't never get canceled\nI ain't trippin' about the price, I gotta get what I'm payin' for\nIt's the principle\n\nPhantom doors came suicide, used to have to catch a ride\nI ain't tryna go too deep, maybe we can catch a vibe\nMaybe we can slide, dependin' on what your plans like\nI might play it quiet but you know that I'm the man, right?\nYou gon' have to pick a side, come here, let me pick your mind\nYou can tell me all your flaws, I'll get someone to fix your body\nShe love when I thug and like when I get romantic\nShe wanna be gang, I got her doin' our handshake"}
