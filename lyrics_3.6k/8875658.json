Somethin' happen in your past?\nWell, the sadness, yeah, I promise that it won't last\nAnd if I could, I would try to take it all back\nThere's still more underneath and that's when you say to me\n\n\"Can you pull the curtains? Let me see the sunshine\nI think I'm done with my hidin' place and you found me anyway\nIt's been forever, but I'm feelin' alright\nTears dry and will leave no trace and tomorrow's another day\"\n\nLet me see the sunshine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sunshine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sunshine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sunshine\n\nHide and seek, count to ten and close your eyes\nTry to breathe, see a message and don't reply\nNice to meet, but in reality, say goodbye\nLife can be so beautiful if you try\n\n\"Are you okay?\" Yeah, I guess so\nBut on some days, I feel like I'm trapped in a hole\nBut I keep quiet, so the ones around me don't know\nThat the mountain feels so steep\nAnd I'll say that I'm here to help to carry the load\nAnd the outside rays, they are good for the soul\nSo, let's step out of the dark 'cause, in here, it's so cold\nThe day's not out of reach and that's when you say to me\n\n\"Can you pull the curtains? Let me see the sunshine\nI think I'm done with my hidin' place and you found me anyway\nIt's been forever but I'm feelin' alright\nTears dry and will leave no trace and tomorrow's another day\"\n\nLet me see the sunshine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sunshine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sunshine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sunshine"}
