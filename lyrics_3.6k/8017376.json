(Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya)\nSpinnin' out, waitin' for ya to pull me in (For ya, for ya, for ya)\nI can see you're lonely down there\nDon't you know that I am right here?\nSpinnin' out, waitin' for ya to pull me in (For ya, for ya, for ya)\nI can see you're lonely down there (Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya)\nDon't you know that I am right here?"}
