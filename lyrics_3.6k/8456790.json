(Whatcha say?) Wanna play?\n\nYeah, don't be fooled, I'm only lettin' you down\nThey pursued me on foot, but I hid in the crowd\nLike a ghost, like a ghost\nLike a ghost, like a ghost\nThe seats of my car are filled with cigarette burns\nI got a fire in my eye, a little blood on my shirt\nLet's hit the road, hit the road\nHit the road, hit the road\n\nI know there's a special place in hell\nThat my friends and I know well\nThere's a perfect place to go\nWhen it's time to lose control\n\nNo, I leave them broken-hearted\nOh no, look at the mess we started\nOh no, I leave the broken hearts this way (This way)\nWhatcha say? (Whatcha say?) Wanna play?\n\nNightmare, daydream (No, oh no, oh no, oh no)\nYou can't save me (Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no)\n\nNo way, no, I leave them broken-hearted\nOh no, look at the mess we started\nOh no, I leave the broken hearts this way (Shit)\nOh no, I leave them broken-hearted\nOh no, look at the mess we started\nOh no, I leave the broken hearts this way\nWhatcha say? Everyday, it's a waste, wanna play?"}
