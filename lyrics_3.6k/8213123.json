Know you can't see me\nI go the hardest and then I press repeat\nGive a head start and they still ain't gon' beat me\nBro did some shit that they can't show on TV\nPull up inside a McLaren like, \"beep-beep\"\nI took a half of an E, now I'm geekin'\nPut her on camera, I'm never gon' leak it\nKeep that shit classy, you see me, don't speak to me\nGet her away from me, that's where she need to be\nSwitch the Mercedes sign out for a Brabus B\nI pay 'em all they lil' fee, it don't bother me\nI'm all on top of this shit 'cause I gotta be\n\nGeeked, never sleep (Nah)\nStretch a hundred to millions in weeks\nGot her runnin' and ridin' for me (Ride)\nWhere it's sunny, we gotta retreat (Retreat)\nStraight from London, she out in the East (East)\nLet her shop and she keep the receipts\nDon't you tell him you got it from me\nAfter this, I'ma need therapy\nI been buildin' up my legacy\nHundreds on hundreds, on fold\nI been up so far, somewhere\nStuck at the top and it's nowhere to go\n\nGot two rings and they forty a piece\nGotta ride with a .40 at least\nYou invite her, she leavin' with me\nWhat you pushin'? There's levels to P (Uh)\nI came out the soil, I got mud on my cleats\nEver since \"Run It Up,\" I got my money up, I keep all three of my bitches on fleek\nAlways stay geeked, if I ran into vampires, they would get high off the shit that I bleed\nIf a producer don't take off his tag, I'll do it myself and I'll remake the beat\nWhen I go shoppin', I'm spendin' a bag, it touch the floor when I hold up the receipt (Bag)\nI been goin' ghost and my doors on suicide\nLookin' in the mirror like, \"I really am that guy\"\nStill with my gang, I don't really like to choose sides\nHop off a jet to a check on a Redeye\nRoll up a spliff, mix the grabba with dead guys\nPeople still hatin' and I still don't know why\nFour pockets full, put a molly in a Cacti\n\nGeeked, never sleep\nStretch a hundred to millions in weeks\nGot her runnin' and ridin' for me\nWhere it's sunny, we gotta retreat\nStraight from London, she out in the East\nLet her shop and she keep the receipts\nDon't you tell him you got it from me\nAfter this, I'ma need therapy\nI been buildin' up my legacy\nHundreds on hundreds, on fold\nI been up so far, somewhere\nStuck at the top and it's nowhere to go"}
