This year? Or some other?\nBeen so long since you said things that cover up the lies\nWe can do it this time\nJust have some faith, we can do it this time\nYour favorite thing to say, \"We can do it this time\"\nJust have some faith, we can do it this time\n\nBeen dealing with me rough\nYou're dealing with me rough\nYou're dealing with me rough\nYou're dealing with me rough\nYou're dealing with me rough\nYou're dealing with me rough\nYou're dealing with me rough\nYou're dealing with me rough\nYou're dealing with me\nOh"}
