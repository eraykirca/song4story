'Cause I'm up now\n\nSo let's play truth or dare, dare you to forget\nThat you used to treat me just like anyone\nTruth or dare? Is it true you care?\nNow that you can see the love from everyone (Tell me)\n\nNow you care? (Ah)\nTruth or dare?\nAr\u0435 you playing?\nTruth or dare? (Tell me)\nNow you car\u0435?\nTruth or dare?\nAre you playing?\nTruth or\n\nWould you still want me if I didn't have it all? (All)\nYou could've had it with me, but instead, you gave it up (Gave it, gave it up)\nTell me, when is it gonna get through to you? (Ooh)\nEverybody needs somebody, but I can't be your boo (Boo)\nWhen they ask you questions 'bout me, tell 'em how you\nHow we could've gone places, but you were too impatient (Ah)\n\n(Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)\nCan't handle what I am now\nYou're a fan now and I'm not what I was\n(Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)\nSo tell me, are you down now?

Is it true you care?\nNow that you can see the love from everyone (Tell me)\n\nNow you care? (Ah)\nTruth or dare?\nAre you playing?\nTruth or dare? (Tell me)\nNow you care?\nTruth or dare?\nAre you playing?\nTruth or dare? (Tell me)"}
