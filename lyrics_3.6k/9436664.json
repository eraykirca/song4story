Which-which one, which one is he?\n\nWhen you finally feel the blood you spill into everybody else\nI'll tourniquet your toes to the ground\nPull you in and hold you tight, love you through the heart of night\nSpring your kind ass into town\nYou\u2019ve been playin\u2019 your guitar from arenas to the bars\nSince you were old enough to rhyme a word\nBut your face is gettin' thinner and you\u2019re prayin' for the winter\nAnd I heard you fucked it up with her\n\nI bandage up your body and your bones and your bad days too\nTake care of the blood that your love runs through\nI know all the damage that some days in this dark world does\nYou were laughin' last evenin' at somethin\u2019 I dreamed of\n\nI bandage up your body and your bones and your bad days too\nTake care of the blood that your love runs through\nI know all the damage that some days in this dark world does\nShe were laughin' last evenin' at somethin' I dreamed of\n\nThere's delays on the planes out of Eastern Montana\nWhere you told me you were leavin' from\nYou've been stabbed in the back and the rest of your body\nWon't you tell me where you're bleedin' from?"}
