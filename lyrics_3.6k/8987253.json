Am I dreamin' out? Am I dreamin'?\nYou're my one, one, one in a million\nAnd I can't believe that we're both alive at the same time\n\nAnd I can't believe that w\u0435're both alive at the sam\u0435 time\n\n(Ah)\nYou got me speedin' through the red lights\nYeah, I'm on my way\nWe do it 'cause it feels right\nYeah, you got me so\n\nHigh\nI tripped and found paradise\nNo lie\nI tripped and found paradise in your eyes\nIn your eyes, in your eyes\nIn your eyes, in your eyes (In your eyes, in your eyes)\nIn your eyes\n\nYou're my one, one, one in a million\nIt's like someone picked you outta the sky (Someone picked you outta the sky)\nMaybe I met you for a reason\nAnd I can't believe that we're both alive at the same time\nIs this Heaven now? Am I dreamin' out? Am I dreamin'?\nYou're my one, one, one in a million\nAnd I can't believe that we're both alive at the same time\n\nIs this Heaven now? Am I dreamin' out?\nIs this Heaven now? Am I dreamin'?\nYou're my one, one, one in a million\nAnd I can't believe that we're both alive at the same time\n\nOne, one, one in a million\nAnd I can't believe that we're both alive at the same time"}
