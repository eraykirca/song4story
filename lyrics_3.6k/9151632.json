Would you stand by me?\nWhen the world tries to keep me down (When the world tryna keep me down)\nAnd there's nobody else around (And there's nobody else around)\nKeep it real, can you tell me now? (Tell me now)\nWould you stand by me? Would you stand by me? (Oh yeah)\n\nI don't know why they be playin' with me\nI lose it all, are you stayin' with me?\nAmsterdam, I skipped the red district\nShe love my dawg, but he bad business\nI could've been in the bed with you\nI decided to hang with some bad bitches\nGave me another chance to prove, but she ain't playin' with me\nI'm so sorry for that\nCan I explain? Just give me a second\nYou showed me love and I'll never forget it\nSay you don't got it, they think you dramatic\nLoyalty, baby, that shit automatic\nBrought me to tears, my bro for years\nTold me no, say he ain't got it\nRan it up and I ain't panic\n\nAre you gon' ride for me? You don't switch no sides with me (Yeah)\nI need your honesty, no, baby, don't lie to me (Yeah, yeah)\nAre you gon' stand ten toes? You supposed to give time to me (Yeah)\nBaby, when shit get real, I need your loyalty\n\nIf tomorrow I lost it all\nAnd everything that I have was gone\nWhen there's nobody else to call\nWould you stand by me? Would you stand by me?\nWhen the world tries to keep me down (When the world tryna keep me down)\nAnd there's nobody else around (And there's nobody else around)\nKeep it real, can you tell me now? (Tell me now)\nWould you stand by me? Would you stand by me? (Oh yeah)\n\nWhat if it all goes south, I get ran out of town\nFor good this time, would you still wanna\nWanna hold my hand, let me be your man\nLet me drive you crazy, are you still gonna\nBe somebody I can lean on\nGirl, be somebody I can dream on all night\nThe kind of flame I wanna leave on\nIf you ain't tryna be that, then be gone\n\nIf tomorrow I lost it all\nAnd everything that I have was gone\nWhen there's nobody else to call\nWould you stand by me? Would you stand by me?\nWhen the world tries to keep me down (When the world tryna keep me down)\nAnd there's nobody else around (And there's nobody else around)\nKeep it real, can you tell me now? (Tell me now)\nWould you stand by me? Would you stand by me? (Yeah)\n\nOh\nOh\nOh\nWould you stand by me? Would you stand by me? (Oh yeah)\nOh\nOh\nOh\nWould you stand by me? Would you stand by me? (Yeah)\n\nAre you gon' ride for me? You don't switch no sides with me (Yeah)\nI need your honesty, no, baby, don't lie to me (Yeah, yeah)\nAre you gon' stand ten toes? You supposed to give time to me (Yeah)\nBaby, when shit get real, I need your loyalty"}
