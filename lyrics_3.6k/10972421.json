I know you looking down smiling at me\nI pray that you found some peace and you're finally happy\nBut I can't sleep, dawg, I cry every fucking night\nThis'll probably the hardest chapter of my fucking life\nRemember how we used to ride plotting on a plan\nMe and my nigga had a bond th\u0435 world wouldn't understand\nGod help a nigga understand this crazy lif\u0435 of mine\nSo many funerals, court dates, suites and ties\nI get to thinking 'bout my nigga and can't help but cry\nTell me how you leave me, nigga, without saying bye\nRemember how we used to ride, dog, to you and me\nWe beat that road, we should've been sponsored by GMC\nDeep in my heart, I don't think I could live this life without you\nInterstates and streetlights make me think about you\nCleaner clothes and sprinter vans make me shed a tear\nIt made me cry just like a baby, dog, it been some years\n\"Gotta keep going\" in my brain, but in my heart, I'm feeling pain\nBeefing with depression, wish I had someone to blame\nI follow your every move, go on and lead the way\nIf it weren't for Fat and Pain, nigga, I'd follow you to the grave\n\nAnd I every step I take (Step I take)\nI can hear you say (Hear you say)\nKeep going, keep going (Keep going)\nKeep going, keep going (Keep going)\nAnd it's hard, I know, they want me to move on\nBut I ain't ready to let go, my nigga\nI ain't ready to let go, my nigga\nLook\n\nAnd I been through so many things but this shit the hardest\nTell me why I'm feeling pain, always brokenhearted\nYeah, them niggas did they thing, but you the sharpest\nIn my eyes, you remain the motherfucking largest\nTell me how was seeing Deyjah and your son Tazarus\nTell me do they let us gangsters in the heaven parties\nTell my nigga Fat Feezy that I'm fucked up 'bout him\nAnd tell my nigga Brock I'm sorry that I left without him\nAnd they ask if I'm okay, I just lie about it\nTo myself I cry about it then get high about it\nThem niggas knew how you was feeling and they let me know\nYou could've told me anything, I wouldn't tell a soul\nTell me why Simmons signed, I can't stop from crying\nTell me that you ain't alright and I wouldn't leave your side\nNigga, we undefeated, why you leave like this?\nWe did the impossible, it ain't shit you can't fix\nNigga, it's impossible for me to see you like that\nTell me how do I move forward without you watching my back\nAnd tell me how do I move on now that you gone, I can't\nThis the last lap of the turtle race\n\nAnd I every step I take (Step I take) (And every step I take)\nI can hear you say (Hear you say) (I hear you say)\nKeep going, keep going (Keep going, keep going)\nKeep going, keep going (Keep going)\nAnd it's hard, I know, they want me to move on\nBut I ain't ready to let go, my nigga\nI ain't ready to let go, my nigga\nAnd I every step I take (Step I take)\nI can hear you say (Hear you say)\nKeep going, keep going\nDon't stop going\nAnd it's hard, I know, they want me to move on\nI ain't ready to let go, my nigga\nI ain't ready to let go, my nigga\nBut I ain't ready to let go, my nigga\nI ain't ready to let go, my nigga\nBut I ain't ready to let go, my nigga\nI ain't ready to let go, my nigga\nBut I ain't ready to let go, my nigga\nI ain't ready to let go, my nigga\nBut I ain't ready to let go, my nigga\nI ain't ready to let go, my nigga\nI ain't ready, I ain't ready, I ain't ready\nI ain't ready to let go, my nigga\nI ain't ready to let go, my nigga\nKeep going, my nigga, keep going"}
