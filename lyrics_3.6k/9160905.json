Am I not hot when I'm in my feelings?\nAnd is my moment finally here, or am I dreaming?\nI'm no dreamer\n\nCan you feel the Ken-ergy?\nFeels so real, my Ken-ergy\nCan you feel the Ken-ergy?\nFeels so real, my Ken-ergy\n\nI'm just Ken\nAnywhere else, I'd be a ten\nIs it my destiny to live and die a life of blond fragility?\nI'm just Ken\nWhere I see love, she sees a friend\nWhat will it take for her to see the man behind the tan and fight for me?\nI'm just Ken (And I'm enough)\nAnd I'm great at doing stuff\nSo, hey, check me out, yeah, I'm just Ken\nMy name's Ken (And so am I)\nPut that manly hand in mine\nSo, hey, world, check me out, yeah, I'm just Ken\nBaby, I'm just Ken\n(Nobody else, nobody else)"}
