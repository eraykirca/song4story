Girl, I always lose to your temptation\nYou're another shot that I shouldn't knock back but damn, baby\nYou're layin' it on, you're leanin' it in\nYeah, I've been keepin' it strong for so long\nBut I need it again, yeah, I need you again\n\n'Cause you're burnin' hotter than a bourbon with no water\nAnd I want your buzz in my veins\nGirl, in the mornin' you'll walk out the door, and\nI'll pour us back down the sink\nBut tonight I d\u0435serve a drink\nI des\u0435rve a drink\n\nI been doin' good, so good\nI been on my best behavior\n\nYou're burnin' hotter than a bourbon with no water\nAnd I want your buzz in my veins\nGirl, in the mornin' you'll walk out the door, and\nI'll pour us back down the sink\nBut tonight your eyes are tellin' me things\nLike I, I deserve a drink\nI deserve a drink"}
