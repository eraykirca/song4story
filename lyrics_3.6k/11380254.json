You left me on E\nIn the jungle, I came out that bitch like a beast\nWith the lions and tigers, can't fuck with no sheep\nCan't compete with a nigga who come from defeat\nHuh, pissed 'em off when I got on my feet\nHuh, pissed 'em off when I got in my bag\nIf a nigga hate me, know he mad\nHow the fuck can you speak out and hate on a nigga who winnin' when you know he worked for that bag?\nSwear it's folks who is weird and they sad\nBut I'm built for it all, that's a fact\nBut the ones who stayed down and believed in a nigga, I swear we gon' shine even when it get bad, ayy\n\nLife's smoking gun loves dangerous\nThat's the way it is, that's the way it was\nWhen you learn to run, it was in the mud\nIt was in the cold, now it's in your blood\nI burn from the hell I've seen\nBut the devil can't hold me down\nI've earned all the hell I'll be\nStandin' on holy ground"}
