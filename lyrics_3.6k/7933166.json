(Oh)\nTake me back to yesterday\nWhen I was wrapped around your finger\nWrapped around your finger\nThen was shot back down to Earth (Shot back down to Earth)\n\nYeah, I'm wrapped around, and around\nAnd around on your finger now (Ooh, ooh, ooh)\nYou got me wrapped around, and around\nAnd around on your finger now (Ooh, ooh)\nI'ma be right down\n\nYou keep me wrapped around your finger\nWrapped around your finger, I was caught up in your orbit\nSpinnin' like a bullet (Spinnin' like a bullet)\nI was wrapped around your finger, wrapped around your finger\nThen I shot back down to Earth (Then was shot back down to Earth)\nI keep wondering who's the one replacing me?\nTake me back to yesterday\nWhen I was wrapped around your finger\nWrapped around your finger\nThen was shot back down to Earth"}
