Ooh, ooh)\nAfter this time I'll be through for real (Bring me that\u2014)\nAfter this time I'll be through for real (Through for real)\n\nI can feel them walls closing\nI can feel it all\nI'm stuck in your claws\nTry to run, but I don't get far\nI'ma put some blame on me\nTryna take accountability\nBut you take on my ability\nYou're the death of me and the remedy\nI be doing too much\n\nI be doing shit I really shouldn't do for real (Oh, yeah)\nThat's why I always tell you come through for real (Oh)\nAfter this time I'll be through for real (Ooh)\nAfter this time I'll be through for real\nI be doing shit I really shouldn't do for real (I've been doing shit I shouldn't do)\nThat's why I always tell you come through for real (Baby, where you at? Ooh, ooh)\nAfter this time I'll be through for real (Bring me that\u2014)\nAfter this time I'll be through for real"}
