Back on 74 (When I noticed you)\nCall this place my home (Ooh, ooh)\nNever gonna cry anymore\nWhere did it all\u2014\n\n(Ooh, oh, oh-oh)\n(Ooh, oh, oh-oh)\n(Ooh, oh, oh-oh)\n(Ooh, oh, oh-oh)\n\nYou keep me walking on the same line\nWhen we get high on my break time\nAnd we're just watching from the same town\nBut that don't change when it break down\nThen we were talking 'bout the same crime\nNo, it don't hurt when it rains now\nI learnt my lesson at the same time\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh, where did it\n\nGo? Back on 74 (When I noticed you)\nCall this place my home (Ooh, ooh)\nNever gonna cry anymore\nWhere did it all\n\nGo, let it go\nLet it go, ooh\nLet it go, let it go\nLet it go, ooh\n\nGo, back on 74 (When I noticed you)\nCall this place my home (Ooh, ooh)\nNever gonna cry anymore\nWhere did it all\n\nGo, let it go\nLet it go, ooh\nLet it go, let it go\nLet it go\nWhere did it all\n\nGo? Back on 74 (When I noticed you)\nCall this place my home (Ooh, ooh)\nNever gonna cry anymore\nWhere did it all\nGo? Back on 74 (Go, let it go, let it go, ooh)\nCall this place my home (Let it go, let it go)\nNever gonna cry anymore (Let it go, ooh)\nWhere did it all\n\nGo? Back on 74\nCall this place my home\nNever gonna cry anymore\nWhere did it all\u2014"}
