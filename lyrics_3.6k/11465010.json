(To keep holding)\nThe common leads away (Keep holding strong)\nBut is it only years away now? (Keep holding on)\nI have come to learn replace (I, I know that it's best)\nAnd I resemble other traits of the lord (To keep going)\nI have rendered other fates (These memories hold)\nAnd I've been prowling on the brakes now (These memories fade)\n\nAh, ahh\nBut what a taste\nOh, babe\nIn every way\nNot for the freight\nI'll best alone\nIn high ways\nMm-hmm-mm"}
