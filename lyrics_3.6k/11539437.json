Fuckin' relationships\nDon't they end up all the same\nWhen there's no one left to blame?\nI think I'm in love, but I can't stand fuckin' relationships\n(Goes, goes like, goes like)\n\nWhy do I have a guilty conscience?\nI've always been averse to conflict\nBut you really fucked with my confidence\n(Goes like, goes like, goes like)\n\nYou gotta tell me the truth\nIf you don't want to try (Goes, goes like, goes like)\nI hear a voice in my head\nAnd it keeps asking, \"Why am I in this relationship?\"\n\nBaby, how can I explain\nWhen an innocent mistake\nTurns into seventeen days? Fuckin' relationships\nDon't they end up all the same\nWhen there's no one left to blame?\nI think I'm in love, but I can't stand fuckin' relationships\n(Goes, goes like, goes like)\n\nRelationships\nHow did we get ourselves into this?\nRelationships\nOh, this can't just be the way it is\nRelationships\nOr is it just the shit our parents did\nAnd had to live with it\nIn their relationship?\nRelationships ('Ships, 'ships, 'ships)\nRelationships\nFuckin' relationships\n\nBaby, how can I explain\nWhen an innocent mistake\nTurns into seventeen days? Fuckin' relationships\nDon't they end up all the same\nWhen there's no one left to blame?\nI think I'm in love, but I can't stand communicating it\nLet me tell you how it ends\nWhen we can't even pretend\nFeels like we're not even friends in this relationship\nBut I would do it all again\nIf you put down your defenses\nI think I'm in love, so why am I trying to escape from it?\nMaybe that's just how it goes\nWhen you're not fully grown\nBut baby, when you know, you know, fuckin' relationships\nSo don't let it bring you down\n'Cause it all comes back around\nI think I'm in love, but I can't stand fuckin' relationships"}
