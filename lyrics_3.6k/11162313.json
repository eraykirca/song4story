(Yeah)\nHow can you look at me and pretend\nI'm someone you've never met?\n\nThe devil in your eyes\nWon't deny the lies you've sold\nI'm holding on too tight\nWhile you let go\nThis is casual\n\nHow can we go back to being friends\nWhen we just shared a bed? (Yeah)\nHow can you look at me and pretend\nI'm someone you've never met?\nHow can we go back to being friends\nWhen we just shared a bed? (Yeah)\nHow can you look at me and pretend\nI'm someone you've never met?\n\nI'm someone you've never met (Yeah)"}
