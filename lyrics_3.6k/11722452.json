Oh\nIs bittersweet the only remedy?\nIt's chasing something that we used to be\nBut I'll fight to keep you with me\nYeah, even if it kills me\n\nAnd maybe I should've held you closer\nOn the nights that I had the chance\nMaybe time should've made me colder\nI got other plans\n\nI'll save my love for you (I'll save my love)\nI'll save my love for you (I'll save my love)\nJust tell me if you're ready (If you're ready), 'cause if you're ready (If you're ready)\nI am too\nI'll save my love for you (I'll save my love for you)\nIt's all for you (I'll save my love)\nJust tell me if you're ready (If you're ready), 'cause if you're ready (If you're ready)\nI am too (I am too)\nI'll save my love for you\n\nI'll save my love for you (I'll save my love for you)\nIt's all for you (I'll save my love)\nJust tell me if you're ready (If you're ready), 'cause if you're ready (If you're ready)\nI am too (I am too)\nI'll save my love for you"}
