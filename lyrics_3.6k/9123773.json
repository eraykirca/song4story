Nobody\nTake me outside, I'm a little too high\nPaid a little too much for the time of my life\nWhen money ain't a problem, everyone's lyin'\nEven when I tell myself that I\n\nDon't wanna sober up\nThe sun is killin' my buzz, that's why they call it mourning\nThought I was strong enough\nThrew my bottle at the sky, said, \"God, that's a warning\"\nDon't wanna sober up\nTry to keep it inside, but I just wanna pour it\nThought I was strong enough\nGot a lotta shit to say, couldn't fit it in the chorus"}
