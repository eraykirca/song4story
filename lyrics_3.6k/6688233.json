Come on\n\nShe's not a saint and she's not what you think (No)\nShe's an actress, woah (You know that you deserve this)\nHe was a moth to the flame\nShe was holding the matches, woah\nSoon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys\nOn the playground won't make you many friends\nShe should keep in mind, she should keep in mind\nThere is nothing I do better than revenge\n\n(Come on) Do you still feel like you know what you're doin'?\n'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)\nDo you still feel like you know what you're doin'? (No)\nI don't think you do, I don't think you do\nLet's hear the applause (Come on, come on)\n(Oh, oh) Come on, show me how much better you are (So much better, yeah?)\nSo you deserve some applause\n'Cause you're so much better\nShe took him faster than you could say \"sabotage\""}
