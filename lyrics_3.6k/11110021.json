Time's slipping away\nAnd without me, I wonder if you're truly okay\nYou ask me, \"Why?\" and I say, \"Why lie?\"\nDeep down, we both know it's clear to see\nIt's eating you up\nTo say you're better off without me\n\nI tried to act tough but it fell apart\nYou tried to be my friend, and I kissed you\nYou know the truth\nWe can't control what we feel inside\nI call others just to try to forget\nBut in my mind, it's you on repeat\nMore than a fleeting fire, baby, you disguise it\nThat's why we're here\n\nYou ask me, \"Why?\" and I say, \"Why not?\"\nIf we're nothing, then what are we doing here?\nWhat are we playing at? Time's slipping away\nAnd without me, I wonder if you're truly okay\nYou ask me, \"Why?\" and I say, \"Why lie?\"\nDeep down, we both know it's clear to see\nIt's eating you up\nTo say you're better off without me\n\nRauw\nWhat's the name of this game we're caught in, both of us?\nWith the masks we wear, the truth is hidden from view\nYou knew all along\nI loved you more than I let on\nI say \"Let me go,\" but inside I'm aching\nWhen I'm lost\nI reach for you, but stay silent\n\nStay\nWhere are you going? Come, don't leave me now\nBaby, stay\nWhere are you running off to?\n\nYou ask me, \"Why?\" and I say, \"Why not?\"\nDeep down, we both know it's clear to see\nIt's eating you up\nTo say you're better off without me\n\nYou ask me, \"Why?\"\nAnd I say, \"Why not?,\" and I say, \"Why not?\"\nYou ask me, \"Why?\"\nAnd without me, I wonder if you're truly okay\nBaby\nIt's Rauw Alejandro with The King Romeo, haha (The biggest)\nBaby, I don't know what it is that we are, just know it's special\n\nI wrote down my feelings, then erased them\nTold you I didn't love you, and I ruined it\nBut I knew\n(When you walked away, all I longed for was to kiss you)"}
