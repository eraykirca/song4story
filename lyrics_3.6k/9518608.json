That's what I'm on\nI don't want no rap beef, no-no-no-no, no-no\n\nI came, I came, I came, I came, I came to kill the game\nBut everybody ain't my friend, and I don't like all y'all records\nNow if you wanna diss me and get down with me, go'n and do it\nBut the difference between me and them other dudes is this\nYou gon' diss me and I'm gon' come see you, Jack\nYou gon' diss them other dudes, they gon' play hip-wrestle with you\nSo if you want it, man, come on with it\nIf you want it with me, come on with it, leave Bun out of it\nAnd we gon' see in the end\n'Cause you gon' smell my cologne\nIssey Miyake"}
