Motherfucker been dead since five\nSeen my dad OD at nine, was never the same again\nI never had a chance to win\n\nI keep reachin' out for help\nI can't tell if I'm too concerned with myself\nFeel like I'm just collectin' dust on the shelf (Fuck it, fuck it)\nI think it's time to bid farewell\n\nLeft all the lights on, but I ain't home, thirty thousand feet up\nGot my ice on, but I ain't cold, thirty thousand degrees\nYup, I stashed thirty thousand in the freezer\nFeel like a crooked congressman\nI blame it on Percocet amnesia, can't keep up with my tolerance\nI'm tryna win this war on drugs, but I lost the battle by callin' up the plug\nGot back in the saddle\nMoth to the flame, I'm insane, all these voices rattle\nFoggin' up my brain, numb the pain, locked up in my castle\nI'm startin' to unravel, surrounded by all these snakes and jackals\nThey keep temptin' me to eat the apple\nI need to tie up loose ends, form these threads into a tassel\n\nI keep reachin' out for help\nI can't tell if I'm too concerned with myself\nFeel like I'm just collectin' dust on the shelf (Fuck it, fuck it)\nI think it's time to bid farewell\nI keep reachin' out for help\nI can't tell if I'm too concerned with myself\nFeel like I'm just collectin' dust on the shelf (Fuck it, fuck it)\nI think it's time to bid farewell"}
