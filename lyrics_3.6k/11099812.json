I'm not what you need\n\nAnd baby, I'm glitchin'\nSufferin' from indecision\nI been drinkin', rockin' wrong prescriptions\nIs it me or there's been somethin' missin'?\nCan't give you my full submission\n\nGirl, I feel crazy\nThis ain't how the Lord made me\nMaybe, maybe\nAre you still my baby?\nI ask myself this daily\nAnd can you go slowly when you leave? (Gimme some)\nCan you go slowly?\nYou take the lead\n\nI'm lettin' go slowly, it's make believe\nAnd can you go slowly? I'm not what you need\n\nAnd can you go slowly when you leave?"}
