Wah ha ha ha ha ha hah!\nI'm done, I'm done! Wah ha ha ha ha ha hah!\n\nTwistin' all my bones like screws\nStretchin' my self-worth, just like you usually do\nCaught you like the cold or a flu (Achoo!)\nPraying that I'll someday be immune\nGot me like a bad tattoo\nAlways under skin, even when it gets removed\nNever got a chance to undo\nPositions that you forced my way into\n\n(Bones are crushing, bones are crushing) Pushin' me\n(Body's touching, body's touching) Lovin' me\n(Blood is pumping, blood is pumping) Pullin' me\n(Feelin' nothing, feelin' nothing) Fuckin' me\n(Bones are crushing, bones are crushing) Crushin' me\n(Body's touching, body's touching) Touchin' me\nOw!\n\nI'm done, I'm done\nDone doing backbends, I break and I snap\nIt's no fun, no fun\nPushed myself into a box while you held out a gun\nI'm done! Wah ha ha ha ha ha hah!\nI'm done, I'm done! Wah ha ha ha ha ha hah!\n\n(Bones are crushing, bones are crushing) Pushin' me\n(Body's touching, body's touching) Lovin' me\n(Blood is pumping, blood is pumping) Pullin' me\n(Feelin' nothing, feelin' nothing) Fuckin' me\n(Bones are crushing, bones are crushing) Crushin' me\n(Body's touching, body's touching) Touchin' me\n(Blood is pumping, blood is)\nOw!"}
