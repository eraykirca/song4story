You can't see we run stuff?\nI gotta think out the box, I hate bein' bunched up\nGlad that I been through a lot, it made me a monster\nI done seen this shit get grimy, I can't have no conscience\nSee 'em tryna clone me and all, but it's only one me\nIf I came in this world alone, why I get lonely?\nCan someone come unthaw my heart? I think it's frozen\n\nI don't feel a lot of this shit, I can't even hold you\nCatch me in the Hamptons with Mike Rubin or HOV them\nOr catch me in the hood with a Lamborghini with the doors up\nI can't even lie, it broke my heart, I heard you told some\nGotta keep my fire under my jacket, it's a cold world\nShe with me when he go out to practice, this a cold girl\nShe a goblin, she don't even stop it, make your toes curl\nBae, I'm sorry for puttin' our business out there\nYou too cool for a loser, you could be winnin' out here\nYou keep it wet, I'm gon' invest, support yo' swimmin' line\nDon't worry 'bout that, just do yo' best, I promise you'll be fine\nYou let that shit come out yo' mouth, now you can't press rewind, it's stuck there\nFive million cash, all blues, you get a rush, yeah\nI don't need a nigga or a bitch, who the fuck cares?\nYou the one that's really sour, I ain't even gon' go there\nYou was 'posed to be here, but oh well\n\nI don't know what they told you, but you got me fucked up\nYou see how we walked in? You can't see we run stuff?\nI gotta think out the box, I hate bein' bunched up\nGlad that I been through a lot, it made me a monster\nI done seen this shit get grimy, I can't have no conscience\nSee 'em tryna clone me and all, but it's only one me\nIf I came in this world alone, why I get lonely?\nCan someone come unthaw my heart? I think it's frozen"}
