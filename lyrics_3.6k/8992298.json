(Hmm)\n\nAnd I know I'm not the perfect guy\nBut I think I'm doing just alright\nIt doesn't matter what you thought of me then\nBut what you think of me now\nWe haven't always seen eye to eye\nBut right now, won't you look at min\u0435\nDon't be scared, ther\u0435's no such thing as fear\nWhen you sleep, just know that\n\nI'm here for you still\nAnd even if you don't think that I'm near\nI'll still be right next to you, my dear (Hmm)\nAnd the way you make me feel\nHas the power to make the whole world stand still\nWho's to say that our love ain't real?"}
