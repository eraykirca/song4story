(Uh)\n\nAnd if I could go to your show\nI'll be front row (Yeah, yeah)\n\nAnd if they sold your picture in the mall (Uh)\nI would buy 'em all, put 'em on my wall\nSome might say, I'm not your speed\nMight even say you're out of my league, mm\nSo many flaws and insecurities (Oh)\nForever yours, sincerely\nFor a chance, tell me what I got to do\n'Cause I would do it all for you\nSpend a M or two, might hit the gym for you\nGet slim for you (Uh)\nCan't get you off my mind and out of my head\nSo I wrote you a song, play it while you're alone\n\nAnd they might say that I don't have a chance\nBut that's where they're wrong\nI hope that they're wrong\n'Cause I got plans (Plans), give me your hand (Oh)\nHow long will it take for you to understand? (Oh)\nI'm your biggest fan, I'm your biggest fan\nOh, oh (Baby), yeah\nYeah, I'm your biggest fan (Baby, baby)\nOh, oh\nOh, oh\nI'm your biggest fan (Baby, baby)\n\nRight back where you left me\nWould you take me home?\n'Cause there ain't nothin' left here\n'Cause I been waitin' for your love\n'Cause I been waitin' on ya, waitin' for your love\n'Cause I been waitin' for ya, waitin' for your love\nYou got me waitin' for ya, waitin' for your love"}
