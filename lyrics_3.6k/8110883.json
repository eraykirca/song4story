How do I feel?\nHow do you say to my face, \"Time heals\"?\nThen go and leave me again, unreal\nI see us fadin' away\nI'm still holdin' my breath for the day that you will\nSee that the effort I make is too real\nHow can you say that you know how I feel?\nAyy, whee\nHow can you say you know what I'm feeling? Wait\nKnow what I'm feeling, wait\nYou don't feel nothing, wait\nNothing is healing, wait\nTime is just killing, wait\nHow can you say? Wait\nYou know what I'm feeling, wait\nKnow what I'm feeling, wait\nYou don't feel nothing, wait\nTime isn't healing, wait\nTime is revealing, wait\nHow are you feeling? Wait\nYou don't feel nothing\n\nMe\nMe\n\nJust like I expected, falling back on me\nFalling with I, falling back on me\nFalling back on me, falling back on me\nFalling back on m\u0435, falling back on me\nFalling back on me, falling back on me\nFalling back on m\u0435, falling back on me\nFalling back on me, falling back on me\nFalling back on me\nFalling back on me, falling back on me\nFalling back on me, falling back on me\nFalling back on me, falling back on me\nFalling back on me, falling back on me\nWhat would you do without me?\nWhat would you do without me?\nI think you would lose everything\nFallin' back on me\n\nWherever you are, you don't test"}
