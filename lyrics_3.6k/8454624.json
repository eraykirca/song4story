Yeah\n\nThrough with that, said I'm done but then I doubled back\nAre you dumb? You the one, and I'm the cause of that\nFirearm always on me, I be clutching that\nKnow I'm wrong, how the fuck we playing Russian roulette\nAll my life, I had to fight, I feel like Mike\nShootouts every other week, we had that\nBitches every other night, I'm past that\nI'ma always play my part, give a fuck 'bout no awards and shit"}
