Ooh, ooh (Why you gotta be weird?)\nYou ain't gotta be weird, ooh, ooh (Ah)\nGet that outta here, fool (Right this instant)\nRight this instant\n\nL\u0435t me help you read th\u0435 room\nIt's clear you don't know how to\nIf I'm gonna play pretend\nIt's gon' have to involve a check\n\nBecause you're killing me\nWith your retrograded mercury (Entirely too deep for me, yeah)\nWhat sign is it when I leave?\nMmm, and while you're focused on the stars\nYou missed the best part, I know why\n\nWhy you wanna be weird? Ooh, ooh (Why you gotta be weird?)\nYou ain't gotta be weird, ooh, ooh (And get that outta here)\nGet that outta here, fool\nRight (Right this instant)\n\nMy word, you are absurd\nWhat you see normally is probably a blur (Uh-huh)\n'Cause you can't read the room\nEverything was cute till you came through (I'm sayin')\nPlease stop telling folks that we cool\nYou might like me, but I don't like you\nMight hurt but I gotta tell the truth\n'Cause if I waste your time, I'ma waste mine too, oh\n\nOoh, why you wanna be weird? Ooh, ooh (Oh, why you gotta be weird?)\nYou ain't gotta be weird, ooh, ooh (You ain't gotta be weird)\nGet that outta here, fool (Get that outta here)\nRight this instant, oh-oh\nWhy you wanna be weird? Ooh, ooh (Why you wanna be weird? Yeah)\nYou ain't gotta be weird, ooh, ooh (You ain't gotta be weird)\nGet that outta here, fool (I, oh)\nRight this instant\n\nEverybody, just\u2014\nWell"}
