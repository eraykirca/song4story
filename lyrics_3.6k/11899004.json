Better find out, bet\nI'ma walk around the edge of the room and the bed\nWhere I hide my face, pace around\nBetter try to br\u0435athe, pace around, pace around\n\nI ch\u0435ck the doors, check the windows, and pull the blinds\nI check the clock, wondering what he'll pull this time\nI have a feeling that necromancer's outside\nAnd I'm just tryna stay quiet\n\nI don't sleep much, that's crazy, how'd you know that?\nKeep myself up, that's maybe how you know that\nOoh, promises and contracts I used to keep\nI don't sleep much, that's crazy, how'd you know that?\nKeep myself up, that's maybe how you know that\nOoh, my hallucination I used to see\nI used to see\nSleep, I found, ooh\n\nI wanna get out there (Ooh-ooh)\nBut I don't try (Ooh-ooh)\nI wanna get out there (Ooh-ooh)\nBut I don't try (Ooh-ooh)\n\nI check the clock, wondering what he'll pull this time\nI have a feeling that necromancer's outside\nAnd I'm just tryna stay quiet\n\nI don't sleep much, that's crazy, how'd you know that?\nI keep myself up, that's maybe how you know that\nOoh, promises and contracts I used to keep\nI don't sleep much, that's crazy, how'd you know that?\nKeep myself up, that's maybe how you know that\nOoh, my hallucination I used to see\nI used to see\nI used to see\nOoh, my hallucination I used to see\n\nI used to see, it felt so real\nBut now I plead, just take the deal\nI promised you a contract\nI promised you a contract"}
