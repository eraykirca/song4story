They was never supposed to get that, nah\n\nAnd that's just so embarrassin'\nI want to die, to die\n\nAyy, I'm the one that you was wishin' for when you was married\nThat tale wasn't much of a fairy\nChristmas, it wasn't that merry\nYou a trophy to me like the Larry\nAyy, I'm the one that you was wishin' for\nAyy, I'm the one that you was wishin' for\nIn Miami and the owls with me like they just put my ass in Gryffindor\nMouth dry over twenty that I never bother gettin' no prescription for\nSteez sayin' that you miss me and I won't say it to you, but I miss you more\nSaid we got each other back and then you put the knife in it like the kitchen drawer\nWay I'm feelin' on this album, really took it easy on you, coulda written more\nIf the shoe was on the other foot and it was me, it woulda been guerilla war\nSince you know I got a soft spot for you, this has turned into a civil war\nArtists hittin' on you, broke as fuck, I swear them niggas probably live in Singapore\nThe athlete that you rollin' with, I saw his game last night, he didn't score\nFuck, I gotta say a little more\nShow you spots you never been before\nIt's fucked up that we was goin' once and now you're goin' twice like a biddin' war\nWhy you act like just 'cause I go to the strip club, girl, that I don't love you?\nYou still listenin' to R Kelly in the whip, baby girl, and I don't judge you\nI'ma end this shit and let the 40 beat play before I snap\nIn Booby Trap, throwin' more bills than your baby daddy trap\n\nYeah, grrah"}
