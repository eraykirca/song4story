I'm out my mind, I got your son bangin' slime\nWho left him dead up inside the neighborhood? That was I\nDon't cross that line, respect my mind, bitch, I'm gon' hit you with that iron\nI'm a grimy motherfucker, tell them Trinidad my kind\nShit, look, we bang too, what it is you wanna do?\nOh, you wanna try mine? We gon' slump you\nAnd then flex on you bitches like Big Dump do\nI don't dance, I just bop, you gotta watch inside the party\nShe wanna fuck, let me record it\nMy music make her act retarded, slime\n\nMy sound, it's from the town\nMy sound make the pros gather 'round\nMy sound no playin' with sound\nMy sound kill, kill sound\n\nMy sound rude boy sound\nMy sound (Real deal sound)\nMy sound jungle sound\nMy sound jungle sound\nMy sound\nMy sound"}
