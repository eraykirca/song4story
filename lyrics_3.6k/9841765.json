Yeah\nD-Generation\nWho's keeping score?\n\n'Cause you got a taste now, drank the Kool-Aid by the jug\nSo suffer your fate, oh, come here and give me a hug\nNobody loves you like I love you, oh, my dear\nBut you should've known that this was gonna end in tears\n\nSuch a sucker for an execution\nThe void is a vampire, fat on our blood\nDomesticated like a cat in a cage\nWhile they try their hand at playing God\n\nIs this what you wanted? No\nDo you want some more-e-e-e? Yeah\nD-Generation\nAfraid there's no cure\n\n'Cause you got a taste now, drank the Kool-Aid by the jug\nSo suffer your fate, oh, come here and give me a hug\nNobody loves you like I love you, oh, my dear (Oh, oh-oh)\nBut you should've known that this was gonna end in tears\n\nOh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh\n\nI got my hands around your throat, I love the way you choke\n'Cause I am yours and you are mine, I'll never let you go\nMy hands around your throat, I love the way you choke\n'Cause I am yours and you are mine, I'll never let you go\n\n(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)\nI'll never let you go\n(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
