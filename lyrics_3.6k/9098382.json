Oh-oh-oh\n\nWhatever weather, if it rain or shine\nWhether it's pain, pleasure, good and hard times\nWe might go 'round and 'round, but I won\u2019t back down (Oh)\n\nPeople, they come, and people, they go\nWhen the leaves change and the colors they show\nCan you hold on through the seasons?\nThrough the seasons, oh\nThrough every high and through every low\nA beautiful lie, it never gets old\nCan you hold on through the seasons?\nThrough the seasons, oh\n\nYou slipped a couple times, but it's fine\n'Cause if I started pointin' fingers, you would see mine\nI don't wanna judge you, oh-oh-oh\nYou see from the side when I'm blind\nYou're the one I'm callin' when I need a lifeline\nBut I don't wanna lose you, oh-oh-oh\n\nWhatever weather, if it rain or shine\nWhether it's pain, pleasure, good and hard times\nWe might go 'round and 'round, but I won\u2019t back down (Oh)\n\nPeople, they come, and people, they go\nWhen the leaves change and the colors they show\nCan you hold on through the seasons?\nThrough the seasons, oh\nThrough every high and through every low\nA beautiful lie, it never gets old\nCan you hold on through the seasons?\nThrough the seasons, oh\n\nWhatever weather, if it rain or shine\nWhether it's pain, pleasure, good and hard times\nWe might go 'round and 'round, but I won\u2019t back down (Through the seasons, oh)\nWhatever weather, if it rain or shine\nWhether it's pain, pleasure, good and hard times\nWe might go 'round and 'round, but I won\u2019t back down (Through the seasons, oh)"}
