What's the plan today?)\nToday we're drinking, today we're drinking and no one's gonna stop us\nThe samurai is shining and the crew is hitting the roadside spots (Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)\nKeep coming up (How?), keep coming up (Come over) 'cause we're not backing down (We're not backing down)\nCome up to the mountain, today I'm staying here\nHey, be careful, be careful (Woah) when it's your turn to come down\nDon't go over a cliff and make us have to look out for you\n(Let me tell you something so you know)\nIn the hills, today it's lit\nFrom sunrise to sunset\nIn the hills, today it's lit\nBurning rubber, blowing smoke, turn it up\nIn the hills, today it's lit\nCome up here to feel the energy\nIn the hills, today it's lit\nI'm gonna have another drink while the boys finish the cut"}
