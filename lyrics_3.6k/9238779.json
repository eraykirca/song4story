I gave you shit when I didn't use it\nLemme get that money back, I hope you ain't ran through it\nWanna know how Wunna feel? Then listen to my music\nTalk about that shit and all that knowin' I was clueless\nReal life on the surface, shit, it feel like a movie\nI feel I just don't know no more, what all else'll do me?\n\nI don't know no more, I don't know no more\nI can't put my finger on it, I don't know the code\nThey was never used to money, they don't know how to ball\nThey lookin' for me, they don't know I'm buildin' a wall\nDuckin' the law, I ain't trustin' no one at all\nI know that when you shine they wish some days will be dark (I know that when you shine)\nAnd I know there be a time you really show who you are\nWe burned the bridge and cut the ties and we forever apart\n\nWe burned the bridge and cut the ties and forever apart\nAnd I know there be a time you really show who you are\nThey was never used to money, they don't know how to ball\nThey lookin' for me, they don't know I'm buildin' a wall\n(I know that when you shine)"}
