(Don't understand)\nI was gonna save the planet, but today I got plans\nI guess this is just what I am\n\nI'm an object in motion, I've lost all emotion\nMy two legs are broken, but look at me dance\nAn object in motion, don't ask where I'm going\n'Cause wh\u0435re I am goin' is right where I am (Oh, man)\nAh-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah\nWh\u0435re I am goin' is right where I am\n\n(Inertia)\nYou said you'd break up with her\nBut she met your family\nAnd dating's the worst, yeah\n(Inertia)\nNow, you're not in love anymore\nBut you'll stick it out\nFor, like, twenty years more, sayin', oh\n\nDon't you like it bigger, better, but you do what you can? (Do what you can)\nDon't you like a little better when you don't understand? (Don't understand)\nI was gonna save the planet, but today I got plans\nI guess this is just what I am\n\nI'm an object in motion, I've lost all emotion\nMy two legs are broken, but look at me dance\nAn object in motion, don't ask where I'm going\n'Cause where I am goin' is right where I am (Oh, man)\nAh-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah\nWhere I am goin' is right where I am (Oh, man)\nAh-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah\nWhere I am goin' is right where I am\n\n(Inertia)\nI wanna move out of this town\nBut everyone knows me\nAnd packin' is tiring\n(Inertia)\nI said I would start workin' out\nBut I'm fuckin' hungry\nAnd screw you, I'm tryin'\n(Inertia)\nI wanna be big like my plans\nSo why am I so tiny\nAnd why am I so mad?\nIt's inertia (Inertia)\nGuess this is just what I am\nI'm stuck in this life\nAnd I'm stuck in these pants\n\nI'm an object in motion, I've lost all emotion\nMy two legs are broken, but look at me dance (Look at me dance)\nAn object in motion, don't ask where I'm going\n'Cause where I am goin' is right where I am (Oh, man)\nAh-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah (Don't you like it bigger, better, but you do what you can?)\nWhere I am goin' is right where I am (Right where I am; oh, man)\nAh-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah (Don't you like a little better, but you do what you can?)\nWhere I am goin' is right where I am\n\nOh, inertia"}
