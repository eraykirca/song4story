Lost y\u0435ars are wasted\nI always liked you, but I'm glad that you'r\u0435 all dead\n\nVendetta is a friend of mine\nRevenge is sweeter than wine\nI never asked to hear your god-damned feelings\nGet on your knees when you are kissing my ring\n\nBada bing, bada bing, bada boom\nBada bing, bada bing, bada boom\n\nI'm making an offer that you cannot deny\nYou won't be laughing when I'm making you cry\n'Cause, ayy-oh! I hear the pleas get louder\nYou son of a bitch, you're gonna beg and cower\n\nBada bing, bada bing, bada boom\nBada bing, bada bing, bada boom\nBada bing, bada bing, bada boom\nBada bing, bada bing, bada boom"}
