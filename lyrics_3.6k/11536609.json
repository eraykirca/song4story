(For)\nWhat are you waitin' for? (For)\n'Cause I've been standing here\nOh, I've been standing here\nWhat are you waitin' for? (Why do you wait? Why do you wait?)\nWhat are you waitin' for? (Why do you wait? Why do you wait?)\n'Cause I've been standing here\nIt's never been so clear\n\nWhy do you wait? Why do you wait?\nWhy do you wait? Why do you wait?\nWhy do you wait? Why do you wait?\nWhy do you wait? Why do you wait?\n\nTell me to stay, you're wastin' my time\nEvery day I'm waitin' in line\nStanding in place, 'cause, baby, that's all I know\nWhy do you wait? Just tell me\n\nWhat are you waitin' for?\nWhat are you waitin' for?\n'Cause I've been standing here\nOh, I've been standing here\nWhat are you waitin' for? (Why do you wait? Why do you wait?)\nWhat are you waitin' for? (Why do you wait? Why do you wait?)\n'Cause I've been standing here\nOh, I've been standing here, oh"}
