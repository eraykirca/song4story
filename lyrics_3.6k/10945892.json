Understand\nI look for the truth in the back of your hand, and I\nLook into the open sky\n\nStars blink like my sister's eyes (Hey, princess, it's Celi, I'm just calling you to wish you luck on your performance at the caf\u00e9)\nStars blink like my sister's eyes (Um, I love you, you're gonna kill it, bye, baby)\nStars blink like her eyes\nLike her eyes\nI dream of eternal life\nI dream of eternal life"}
