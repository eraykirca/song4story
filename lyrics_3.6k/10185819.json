I gave you everything, ah\nNow I feel you even when you're not there\n\nIt's kinda sad how\nIt's not your fault you're living in a madhouse\nI can't back down\nAren't you tired of blending into the background? (Oh)\nShe's got hearts in her eyes\nSaying, \"Boy, you better watch the time\n'Cause if you're not mine\nI'd rather see you burned alive,\" oh\n\nCheerleader\nSays she hates me 'cause I'm not hers\n(Oh, baby, you tell me, you're singing)\n\nIt's not fair\n'Cause I knew you like the back of my hands\nWell, don't you care? I gave you everything, ah\nNow I feel you even when you're not there\n\nSomehow, I don't even know what she does now\nWell, do I wish her the best or do I actually miss her?\nShe had hearts in her eyes\nShe was rooting for me all the time\nHer love, the type\nThat makes you dedicate your life\nOh, my cheerleader\nThought she needed me, but I need her\n\nIt's not fair\n'Cause I knew you like the back of my hands\nWell, don't you care? I gave you everything, ah\nNow I feel you even when you're not there\nYeah, I feel you even when you're not there"}
