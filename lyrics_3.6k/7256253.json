Oh, oh\n\nBesides turn around and lockin' the door\nWatching your red dress fall to the floor\n\nLet's get some candles burning\nAnd some records turning\nAll the lights down low\nTake it nice and slow\nThe way your body's moving\nKeep doing what you're doing to me all night long\nWritin' our love song\nGirl, I want it, gotta have it\nLet the passion take us to a higher place\nMakin' the kind of love we make\n\nKind of love we make\n\nSo what you say we cancel our plans?\nTonight I'm only gonna be your man\n\nLet's get some candles burning\nSome records turning\nAll the lights down low\nTake it nice and slow\nThe way your body's moving\nKeep doing what you're doing to me all night long\nWritin' our love song\nGirl, I want it, gotta have it\nLet the passion take us to a higher place\nGirl, I want it, gotta have it\nLet the passion take us to a higher place\nMakin' the kind of love we make\nKind of love we make\nMakin' the kind of love we make"}
