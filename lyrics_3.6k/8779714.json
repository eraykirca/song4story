Did you change my name?\nWhen he wants to go to our go-to place\nDo you tell him you can't? Then go out of your way\nTo be somewhere, any damn where I ain't\n\nWhen you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?\nWhen you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missin' my street?\nEvery time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?\nWhen you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?\nComin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine\nJust like you know it's supposed to be\nWhen you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?\nMakin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?\nAre you thinkin' 'bout, are you thinkin' 'bout\nWhen you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?\n\nDon't know where you at\nBut girl, I know where you oughta be\n\nWhen you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?\nWhen you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missing my street?\nEvery time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?\nWhen you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?\nComin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine\nJust like you know it's supposed to be\nWhen you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?\nMakin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?\nYeah, are you thinkin' 'bout me?\nAre you thinkin' 'bout me?"}
