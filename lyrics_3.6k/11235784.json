Well, don't act like you're surprised\nAnd days keep adding up, finding ways to still feel young\nAnd fighting back them heavy hands of time\n\nSo you can lay your cards down if you want to\n'Cause the dealer has the winning hand, and you were born to lose\nAnd good is what you want to be, but that's a side you'll never see\n'Cause fuckin' ups way easier to do\nYeah, well, that sounds pretty on brand for you, for you\n\n'Cause you and I in a room is a bad combination\nAny call after two is a bad conversation\nAnd it's all gas, cut the breaks\nAnd drinking late at degenerate rates\nCalling out to God to give me a sign\n'Cause I'm in a bad state of mind\nOh, I'm in a bad state of mind\n\n'Cause you and I in a room is a bad combination\nAnd any call after two is a bad conversation\nAnd it's all gas, cut the breaks\nAnd drinking late at degenerate rates\nCalling out to God to give me a sign\n'Cause I'm in a bad state of mind\nOh, I'm in a bad state of mind"}
