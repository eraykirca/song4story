Let me pull up and let's talk about it\nI finally got some time alone and I thought about it\nI swear to God your love is war, it's so much I can take\nI been thuggin' for so long, bae, give me a break\nLate nights, I reminisce about you, it's hard to forget about you\nI swear I can't live with you, but I can't live without you\nJump off a plane on an island and I'm here without you\nAin't left my hotel in three days, I feel sick without you, sick without you\nMy stomach do this turning, I feel sick without you\nMy closest friend my worst enemy\nI'm not okay when we apart, but I pretend to be, I\n\nI threw the party of the century\nAnd people came over, no one left sober\nAnd it was all for you\nIt was all for you\nI been under this rock for so long, don't let the world in\nClose the door, don't let the world in\nLet's go and hide in again\nRekindle our flame and light my fire again\nOh, come light my fire again\n\nI threw the party of the century\nAnd people came over, no one left sober\nAnd it was all for you\nIt was all for you\nI threw the party of the century\nAnd people came over, no one left sober\nAnd it was all for you\nIt was all for you"}
