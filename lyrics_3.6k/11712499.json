Am I gonna feel this way forever?\nAre you gonna be around for me to count on? Count on\n\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\n\nSome things just never seem to fade\nI'm thinking about how we were on our first date\nYou understood the words I was saying\nI knew I'd never let you get away\nHold you tight, squeeze you right, tell you what I want\nPut me in your bedroom and I'll sing a little song\nHold you tight, squeeze you right, give you all I've got\nSee you in the morning, over coffee, we'll talk, oh\n\nIs it ever gonna change? Am I gonna feel this way forever?\nAre you gonna be around for me to count on? Count on\n\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\n\n(On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on)\n(On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on)\n(On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on)\n(On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on)"}
