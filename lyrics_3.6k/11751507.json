Jump off a building or talk to your crush?\nTake all your secrets and prized possessions, burn 'em or give 'em to someone you trust?\nI'll be cool with the world on fire as long as everything cordial with us\nTell me you love me, let's meet at the tree on the hill and watch as the world blow up\n\nI ain't afraid of me dyin' alone, I've been spending my money on clothes and diamonds\nNone of this shit make me bulletproof, bro, I don't see what's the point of me buyin' designer\nFindin' a good girl hard, swear I'ma hold on to her wh\u0435never I find her\nBrand-n\u0435w couch in the crib came with a Drac' and a switchy behind the recliner\nNo question, you know I'm behind you\nLV bookbag came with the racks in, broke-ass nigga, I probably could sign you\nThese niggas fucked up lettin' me in\nI ain't goin' back to the old days, nigga, I'll drag on a nigga, he speak on the men\nThese niggas fucked up lettin' me win\nThought I was done, but I did it again\n\nWhat would you do if the world was ending? Jump off a building or talk to your crush?\nTake all your secrets and prized possessions, burn 'em or give 'em to someone you trust?\nI'll be cool with the world on fire as long as everything cordial with us\nTell me you love me, let's meet at the tree on the hill and watch as the world blow up\n\nAlright, thought I was done but I did it again\nThought I was done but I did it again\nWhat would you do if the world was ending? Jump off a building or talk to your crush?\nLV bookbag came with the racks in, nigga try to play, then a nigga get bust"}
