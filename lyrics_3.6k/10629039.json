Said it in between your breath\nI remember when I see the moon\n\nAdd up my love (Ooh)\nAdd up my love (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)\nHoney, was it enough? (Ooh)\nIs it ever enough? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)\n\nIf I could wait for a time\nTo be mad about it, mad about it\nI'd choose a day when you're on your way\nAnd I can say it all to your face, say it to your face\n\nDo you miss my laugh? Hear it from the back of the room\nIt's just somethin' I miss too\nDo you miss all the ways I put you in your place?\nYou say you like all of my attitude\n\nAdd up my love (Ooh)\nAdd up my love (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)\nHoney, was it enough? (Ooh)\nIs it ever enough? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)\n\nOoh, ooh, ooh\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh\n\nAdd up my love (Ooh)\nAdd up my love (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)\nHoney, was it enough? (Ooh)\nIs it ever enough? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)\nAdd up my love (Ooh)\nAdd up my love (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)\nHoney, was it enough? (Ooh)\nIs it ever enough?\n\nOoh, ooh, ooh\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh"}
