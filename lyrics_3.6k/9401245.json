'Cause\u205fnothing is clearer\nTo me\n\nI'm sick of myself, sick of my clothes\nSick of these boys and their obvious jokes\nSick of my tits, sick of my shit\nBored of my car, think I'll go and crash it, oh\n\nWho's down to trade places? I wanna swap faces\nYeah, I can be you, you can be me\nWe can be somebody else\nI'm sick of my, sick of my\u2014\n\nRegret it all when I open my mouth\nShould sew it up and never let it out\nMy skin is crawlin', must be something wrong\nYour personality's nice, can I try it on?\n\nDo you ever wanna be someone?\nDo you ever wanna see somebody\nElse in the mirror? 'Cause nothing is clearer\nTo me\n\nI'm sick of myself, sick of my clothes\nSick of these boys and their obvious jokes\nSick of my tits, sick of my shit\nBored of my car, think I'll go and crash it, oh\n\nWho's down to trade places?\nI wanna swap faces\nYeah, I can be you, you can be me\nWe can be somebody else\nI'm sick of my, sick of my\u2014\n\nI'm sick of my, sick of my\u2014\nElse\nI'm sick of my, sick of my\u2014"}
