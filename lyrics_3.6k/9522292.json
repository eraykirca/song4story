Swear it been a minut\u0435\nOn a late flight from Dallas, on the way back to the city\nTryna balanc\u0435 out my life, I been so booked and busy\nDisconnected from the trenches, but my heart forever in it\nI'm still in this motherfucker with the ones I started with\nI don't need no brand-new friends, only partnerships\nI don't want no fairy tale Instagram model chick\nI don't have the time for the party and the arguin'\n'Member them small clubs? Hole in the wall clubs\nFive-hundred-dollar backends in all dubs\nThese days, it ain't the same, everything done changed\nYoungin get up on stage, seven-fifty for his pain\nAt the basketball arena, but they here for the Wave\nThis motherfucker packed like a playoff game\nAll the women in my life could easily feel a distance\nWhat's the point of havin' my heart if my mind busy?\nAll these niggas claimin' it's love, but I don't get it\nI don't never ever feel love, only tension\nUsed to look up to rappers, but arrivin' what did it\nAin't no friends in this business, cutthroat competition\nLot of niggas get inside this position and lose the vision\nSo I'm focused more than ever, been grindin' like we ain't winnin'\nI was stuck inside that bottom with problems, gettin' evicted\nNow it's back-to-back tours two summers for sixty million\n\nWhere did the day go? (Alright)\nI never get to see you (Alright)\nI never get to feel you (Uh, alright), ooh, ooh\nWhere did the day go?\nI never get to see you\nI never get to feel you, ooh, ooh"}
