(Oh)\nDoes that feel like it's meant to be?\n\nYou and me\nWe were lovers in a past life\nSlow dancin' in the midnight glow\nI wanna hold you for a lifetime\nFor all we know\nAnd these are familiar places\nAnd maybe we're not just strangers\nYou and me\nWe were lovers in a past life\nFor all we know\n\nWe were lovers\n\n(I wanna hold you for a lifetime)"}
