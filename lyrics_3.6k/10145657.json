(Love)\nWho's gettin' all my love?\nTell me who\nWho\u2019s gettin\u2019 all my time?\nAll of that used to be mine, oh\nWho did you teach what I taught ya? (Oh)\nBetter not give him my nickname\nI don't like thinkin\u2019 about it\nI swear that it's wearin' me down, no\nBut tell me who\nWho's gettin\u2019 all of my?\nWho's gettin' all of my residuals?\n\n(Who)\nWho's gettin' all of my?\nWho's gettin' all of my residuals?\n(Who)\nWho's gettin' all of my?\nWho's gettin' all of my residuals?\n\nMade it clear you didn't wanna see the sequel\nI was lyin' when I said the feeling's mutual, oh\nIt took some time to realize that we're different people\nAnd love is blind, I see love is blind\n\nDid we build it up, build it up\nJust to let it wash away?\nAnd tell me, did I lace you up, lace you up\nJust to watch you run away?\n\nPlease tell me who\nWho's gettin' all my love? (Who's gettin'? Love)\nWho's gettin' all my love? (My love)\nAnd tell me who\nWho's gettin' all my time? (My time, no)\nAll of that used to be mine, oh (Believe it)\nWho did you teach what I taught ya? (Oh)\nBetter not give him my nickname\nI don't like thinkin' about it\nI swear that it's wearin' me down, no\nBut tell me who (So tell me who, yeah)\nWho's gettin' all of my? (My)\nWho's gettin' all of my (Oh) residuals?\n\n(Who)\n(Who)"}
