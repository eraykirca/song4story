Tell me what you've heard\nDon't tell me what to do, just tell me when it hurts\nWhen I get you to myself, it's murder\nWhat's the word? Tell me what you've heard\nDon't tell me what to do, just tell me when it hurts\nWhen I get you to myself, it's murder\n\nWhat you mean, you and me? I'm here all by myself\nYou around, she's around, let's be polite and not leave her out\nWhat the fuck you call this? Hopeless, not romantic\nI ain't got no kids, so don't be so childish\nYou be wildin', I be wildin', too\nBut not like you, shit, maybe a little like you\nMaybe we ain't so different, maybe I be trippin', too\n\nWhat's the word? Tell me what you've heard\nDon't tell me what to do, just tell me when it hurts\nWhen I get you to myself, it's murder\nWhat's the word? Tell me what you've heard\nDon't tell me what to do, just tell me when it hurts\nWhen I get you to myself, it's murder\n\nIf he was a winner\nGirl, you wouldn't have to worry 'bout a damn thing\nIf I was up in it, shit, I bet a pound that I'd put it down\nMake you forget that you was ever with him\nAnd I hate talking 'bout my stroke game\nBut girl, I'm giving you the whole thing\nI could put like 25 on your finger, five for your shades\nSo you can't see these other niggas\nThey won't call you again, that's enough\nI could see you're wasting time\nWould you pay it out to me? You're in the wrong hands\nI just want to clock in, night and day, I'll stay\nI'll be more open if you keep it open\n\nLet me hear that"}
