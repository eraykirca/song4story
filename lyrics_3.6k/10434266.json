Check, check\nGo get out the game, make that bubble drop, yes, yes\nShit, I better park the whip quick\nTryna lose your lipstick on the tip, tip\n'Bout to take a quick trip for this misfit\nTiny frame, it'd be a shame if it didn't fit\nI'm just a nigga with some good intentions and a bad plan\nIf you really listen, I been dying, man\nHopeful wishing with some broken wings\nBut I'm still fly\n(Can't lie, still fly)"}
