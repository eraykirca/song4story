(Ex find out)\nWhere there's a will, then there's a way, and I'm damn sure you lost it\nDidn't even say goodbye, just wish I knew what caused it\nWas the whiskey flowin'? Were you in a fight? (In a fight)\nDid the nerves come get you? What's your alibi? (Alibi)\nI made my way back to LA, and that's where you'll be forgotten\nIn forty years, you'll still be here, drunk, washed up in Austin\n\nHell of a bluff, you had me believin'\nHow many months did you plan on leavin'?\nWhat happened? Bad habits?\nDid you go back? Go batshit?\nI loved you, how tragic, oh-oh\n\nDid your boots stop workin'? Did your truck break down? (Truck break down)\nDid you burn through money? Did your ex find out? (Ex find out)\nWhere there's a will, then there's a way, and I'm damn sure you lost it\nDidn't even say goodbye, just wish I knew what caused it\nWas the whiskey flowin'? Were you in a fight? (In a fight)\nDid the nerves come get you? What's your alibi?
