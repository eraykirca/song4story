Oh, look Wick just walked in here\nI don't be with fuck niggas, but I keep my FN\nBro go move the double R, we got somebody blocked in\nJust saw my partner from Atlanta, he said \"You fresh as fuck, twin\"\nSwing that stick like Jackie Robinson and we slide home\nHe so innocent in real life, but gangster on the phone\nFunny how she say that I'm the dog, but ate me off the bone\nI heard her nigga mad, she came home smelling like my cologne\nAll I know is go, it ain't no stoppin', ain't no slowin' down\nI don't want that nigga around me if he ain't gon' pow-pow\nI don't want that necklace if that Cuban link don't bling-baow\nI don't want that pretty girl if she don't know how to work her mouth\nWe look like some old people, everybody got a stick\nKnow my phone ain't never dead, but I pull up five percent\nWhen I walk, my chains go back and forth like they in an argument\nIf he stare at this car too long, \"Grrah, grrah\" through the tint\n\nThey don't want no problems with us ('Cause it ain't safe)\nThey don't want no problems with us (That shit ain't safe)\nThey don't want no problems with us ('Cause it ain't safe)\nYou don't want no problems with us (That shit ain't safe)\n\nI'm in the cut, uh, scissor, I'm a cutthroat lil' nigga\nI been fucking her since December, now her butt been gettin' bigger\nNobody ain't told me I was trippin' when I picked up the pistol\nStarted off with good intentions, how the fuck I turned to a killer?\nCutthroat motherfucker, I go straight for the jugular\nI'ma cut through with that cutter, doo-doo-doo-doo, did I stutter?\nI'm sleepin' on this side of the bed tonight, bitch, don't touch me\nFinna breeze through every nigga block I don't fuck with\nAin't none of my homeboys got stepped on 'cause we do the stompin'\nDon't fuck with niggas from the ugly corner, this shit gon' get ugly\nWe ain't have shit in the projects, so I made it regardless\nAnd I never ain't have a problem I couldn't solve with my chopper (This shit ain't safe, this shit ain't safe)\n\nThey don't want no problems with us ('Cause it ain't safe)\nThey don't want no problems with us (That shit ain't safe)\nThey don't want no problems with us ('Cause it ain't safe)\nYou don't want no problems with us (That shit ain't safe)\n\nThis shit ain't safe, this shit ain't safe ('Cause it ain't safe)\nThis shit ain't safe, this shit ain't safe (That shit ain't safe)\nThis shit ain't safe, this shit ain't safe ('Cause it ain't safe)\nThis shit ain't safe, this shit ain't safe (That shit ain't safe)"}
