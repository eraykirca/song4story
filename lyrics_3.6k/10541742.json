No, no, no, I don't feel sorry for you\nYou're great\nI asked you because\nBecause\n\nBecause you are so beautiful\nBoq, I think you're wonderful\nAnd we deserve each other\nDon't you see this is our chance?\nWe deserve each other\nDon't we, Boq?\nYou know what?\nLet's dance\nWhat?\n\nLet's dance\n\nDancing through life here at the Ozdust\nIf only because dust is what we come to\nAnd here's the strange thing, your life could end up changing\nWhile you're dancing through"}
