(Oh)\nAre we over each other? (Oh)\n\nI can't go to sleep\nI lie awake at night\nI'm so tired of talkin'\nOver each other (Over each other)\nSo say what's underneath\nI wanna see your side\nWe don't have to be talkin'\nOver each other (Over each other)\nOver each other\nOver each other\nOver each other\nOver each other\n\nYou got it\nThat's the one\nAre you recording this?\n'Kay, get your screaming pants on"}
