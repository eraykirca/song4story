(Huh)\nOr do you fear me? (Ow)\n\nCan we stand for something?\nNow is the time to face the wind (Ow)\nComing in peace and love, y'all\nOh, a lot of takin' up space\nSalty tears beyond my gaze\nCan you stand me?\n(Can you stand me? Can you stand me? Can you stand me?)\nOoh, ah\nCan we stand?\n(Can you stand me? Can you stand me? Can you stand me?\nCan you stand me? Can you stand me? Can you stand me?)\nCan you stand with me?\n\nCan we stand for something?\nNow is the time to face the wind\nNow ain't the time to pretend\nNow is the time to let love in\n\nThinkin' to myself (Thinkin' to myself)\nOh, it's a lot of talkin' goin' on (Oh)\nWhile I sing my song (Yeah)\nDo you hear me when I say?\nDo you hear me when I say? Ah\n\nLooka there, looka there\nLooka, look\nLooka-looka-looka-looka-looka\nLooka-looka there, looka there\nL-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-looka there\nOh, looka there, looka there\nLooka there, looka there\n(Can you stand me? Can you stand me? Can you stand me?)\nL-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L\n(Can you stand me? Can you stand me? Can you stand me?)\n\nCan we stand for something?\nNow is the time to face the wind (Now is the time to face the wind)\nNow ain't the time to pretend\nNow is the time to let love in (To let love in)\nTogether, can we stand?\n\nLooka there, looka in my hand\nThe grandbaby of a moonshine man\nGadsden, Alabama\nGot folk down in Galveston, rooted in Louisiana\nUsed to say I spoke too country\nAnd the rejection came, said I wasn't country 'nough\nSaid I wouldn't saddle up, but\nIf that ain't country, tell me what is?\nPlant my bare feet on solid ground for years\nThey don't, don't know how hard I had to fight for this\nWhen I sang my song\n\n(When I sang the song of Abraham)\n(When the angels guide and take my hand)\n(Oh, no)\nGoodbye to what has been\nA pretty house that we never settled in\nA funeral for fair-weather friends\nI am the one to cleanse me of my Father's sins\nAmerican Requiem\nThem big ideas (Yeah) are buried here (Yeah)\nAmen"}
