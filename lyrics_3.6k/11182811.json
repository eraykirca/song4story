I can tell you're feenin'\nAnd I don't wanna hurt your feelings\nBut, baby, just know my feeling's gone\nIt's been a while, but you've been on my mind now\nIt keeps me up at night, I cannot believe this life, I\nI wish I never met you, I even second guessed you\nBut I was in too deep, I couldn't leave I couldn't let you\nWalk away from everything, I thought that you were everything\nYou told me I was special, girl\nBut that does not mean anything to me\n\nIt don't mean anything to me (I tried)\nIt don't mean anything to me\n(You're special, David)"}
