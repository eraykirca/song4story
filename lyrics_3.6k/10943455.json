Am I that bad?\nYou felt like you had to take my broken heart and fix it\nJust to turn around, turn around\nAnd break it right back, break it right back\n\nYou knew my past and begged me to try\nTo love again, because it'd end different this time\nBut words are just words, and you're just a guy\nAnd I'm just the girl you looked at like a prize\n\nYou weren't supposed to be just like the rest\nYou swore up and down that, you loved me to death\nNow we're in my driveway, and I'm now your ex\n'Cause I'm way too much, and you need something less\nOh, why does this happen every time?\nWhat's wrong with me? Am I that bad?\nYou felt like you had to take my broken heart and fix it\nJust to turn around, turn around\nAnd break it right back\n\nSo go use your fancy big words at your fancy big job\nTell your friends how you're right and how I'm just so wrong\nAnd how you do it all, and I don't do enough\nHow you can't settle down with a girl that lives on a tour bus\n\nYou weren't supposed to be just like the rest\nYou swore up and down that, you loved me to death\nNow we're in my driveway, and I'm now your ex\n'Cause I'm way too much, and you need something less\nOh, why does this happen every time?\nWhat's wrong with me? Am I that bad?\nYou felt like you had to take my broken heart and fix it\nJust to turn around, turn around\nAnd break it right back"}
