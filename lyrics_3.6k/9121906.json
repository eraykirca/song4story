There's nobody like you\nLa-la-like you, I la-la-la-like you, ooh\n\nI run into you everywhere\nBut you push me away\nDoes it mean you're still with her?\nShe convinced you to stay?\nI know it's wrong, but\nI cannot help it, I (I cannot help it)\nI know it's wrong, but\nI cannot take it, I (I cannot take it)\n\nI know it's wrong, but\nI, I, I like you\n\nLa-la-like you, I la-la-la-like you\nLa-la-like you, I la-la-la-like you, ooh\nWhat do I do? There's nobody like you\nLa-la-like you, I la-la-la-like you, ooh\n(I know it's wrong, but)\nLa-la-like you, I la-la-la-like you\nLa-la-like you, I la-la-la-like you, ooh\nWhat do I do? There's nobody like you\nLa-la-like you, I la-la-la-like you, ooh\nI want you tonight\n\nI don't know, but\nSometimes, when you find love\nThe wrong thing is right\nIt might be hard\nBut worth the fight\nReal love"}
