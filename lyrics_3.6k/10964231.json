I'm rich as fuck\nHoes don't want love, all these hoes want a tummy tuck\nThese niggas ain't gangster just mad that they just broke as fuck\nEase the pain when I drink out that double cup\nOnly time that I'm hurt when I sober up\nSmile in your face, but I swear that's a cover up\nRappin' my pain, this the shit that y'all wanted\n\nLike where was these folks when in that spot with the kitchen?\nOr where was these folks when my pockets was empty?\nWhere was these folks the long nights when I was dealin'?\nHow you gon' want what I got ain't did it?\nI have lost the love\nLow it's my heart paining"}
