Well, I can try\nAnd as I roll along I begin to find\nThings aren't always just what they seem\n\nI wanna turn the whole thing upside down\nI'll find the things they say just can't be found\nI'll share this love I find with everyone\nWe'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs\nThis world keeps spinning\n\nAnd there's no time to waste\nWell, it all keeps spinning, spinning 'round and 'round\nAnd upside down\nWho's to say what's impossible and can't be found?\nI don't want this feeling to go away\n\nPlease don't go away\nPlease don't go away\nPlease don't go away\nIs this how it's supposed to be?\nIs this how it's supposed to be?"}
