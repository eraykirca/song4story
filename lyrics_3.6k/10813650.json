{"id": 10813650, "title": "Panic Attack", "artist": "Halsey", "lyrics": "My body carries sadness that my brain cannot yet see\nAnd I've been holding on to memories in my stomach and my teeth\nAnd both my shoulders have been burdened by the weight of my mistakes\nAnd every time you lean in closer, both my knees can't help but shake\n\nAnd I think you're a danger to my health, or so it seems\n\nIs it love or a panic attack?\nIs a heavy heart too much to hold?\nI don't know, but it's late, so I'm taking you home\nIs it love or a panic attack?\nWould you mind if I asked you on the phone?\nI don't know, but it's late, so I'm taking you home\nMm-mm\n\nI had to call the doctor, left a note on his machine\nBecause I tripped when we went walking and I felt it in my spleen\nNow I think I need a blood test or an antihistamine\nBecause you make me fucking nervous\nAnd I don't know what it all means\n\nAnd I think you're a danger to my health, or so it seems\n\nIs it love or a panic attack?\nIs a heavy heart too much to hold?\nI don't know, but it's late, so I'm taking you home\nIs it love or a panic attack?\nWould you mind if I asked you on the phone?\nI don't know, but it's late, so I'm taking you home\n\nMy spirit has been broken\nMy optimism's getting sore\nAnd I would love to love you\nBut my body's keepin' score\nAnd I don't know if I can see you anymore\n\nIs it love, is it love (Is it love, is it love, is it love?)\nIs it love, is it love (Is it love, is it love?)\nIs it love or a panic attack?\nIs a heavy heart too much to hold?\nI don't know, but it's late, so I'm taking you home\nIs it love or a panic attack? (Is it love, is it love?)\nWould you mind if I asked you on the phone?\nI don't know, but it's late, so I'm taking you home"}
