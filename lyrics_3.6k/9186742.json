Is it free like they say?\nDoes the sun shine bright forever?\nHave your fears and your pain gone away?\n\nAnd I hope you're dancin' in the sky\nAnd I hope you're singin' in the angels' choir\nAnd I hope them angels know what they have\n'Cause I bet it's so nice up in Heaven since you arrived\n\nAnd I hope you're dancin' in the sky\nAnd I hope you're singin' in the angel choir\nAnd I hope them angels know what they have\n'Cause I bet it's so nice up in Heaven since you arrived"}
