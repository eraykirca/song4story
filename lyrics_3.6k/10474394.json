No, probably not\nAll I got left to do is sit here and drink\nAnother lonely night down at the bar\n\n'Cause I'm getting into fights and I'm falling hard\nMaxing out one more credit card\nWhat's this life worth living for?\nI'm going to jail, I can't pay my bail\nJack and Coke won't let me think for myself\nShoulda never reached for that bottle on the shelf\nShoulda never reached for that bottle on the shelf"}
