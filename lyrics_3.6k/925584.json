I really did see mommy kissing Santa Claus\nAnd I'm gonna tell my dad\n\nThen I saw mommy tickle Santa Claus (Tickle, tickle, Santa Claus)\nUnderneath his beard so snowy white\nOh, what a laugh it would have been\nIf Daddy had only seen\nMommy kissing Santa Claus last night\nOh, what a laugh it would have been\nIf Daddy had only seen\nMommy kissing Santa Claus last night\n\nI did! I did! I really did see mommy kissing Santa Claus\nYou gotta believe me! You just gotta believe me!\nCome on, fellas, believe me!\nYou just gotta believe me! (I told you, I told you)\nCome on, you gotta believe me!\nI did!"}
