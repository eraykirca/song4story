(Taylor's Version) [From The Vault]", "artist": "Taylor Swift", "lyrics": "Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)\nWith the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)\nI slept all alone (Uh-huh)\nYou still wouldn't go\n\nLet's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later\nI see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters\nYou dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor\nYou search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby\n\nWas it over when she laid down on your couch?\nWas it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?\n\"Come here,\" I whispered in your ear\nIn your dream as you pass\u0435d out, baby\nWas it over then? And is it over now?\n\n(Is it? Is it? Is it?)\n\nWh\u0435n you lost control (Uh-huh)\nRed blood, white snow (Uh-huh)\nBlue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)\nYour new girl is my clone\n\nAnd did you think I didn't see you?\nThere were flashin' lights\nAt least I had the decency\nTo keep my nights out of sight\nOnly rumors 'bout my hips and thighs\nAnd my whispered sighs\nOh, Lord, I think about jumpin'\nOff of very tall somethings\nJust to see you come runnin'\nAnd say the one thing I've been wanting, but no\n\nLet's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)\nIf she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)\nYou dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)\nYou search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby\n\nWas it over when she laid down on your couch?\nWas it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?\n\"Come here,\" I whispered in your ear\nIn your dream as you passed out, baby\nWas it over then? And is it over now?\nUh-huh\n(Is it? Is it? Is it?)\nUh-huh\n(Is it? Is it?)\n\nThink I didn't see you?\nThere were flashin' lights\nAt least I had the decency\nTo keep my nights out of sight\nOnly rumors 'bout my hips and thighs\nAnd my whispered sighs\nOh, Lord, I think about jumpin'\nOff of very tall somethings\nJust to see you come runnin' (Runnin')\nAnd say the one thing I've been wanting, but no\n\n(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)\nLet's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)\n(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there\nAnd say the one thing (Oh, Lord)\nI've been wanting (Oh, Lord)\nBut no\n(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)"}
