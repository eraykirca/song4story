Tonight, we might get it right\n\nI never say never with you, I end up together with you\nIt's hell and it's heaven with you, baby\nAnything's possible, the highs are unstoppable\nIt's so uncontrollable, it's crazy\nWe say we won't and then we do\nYou're all I want, I never say never with you, yeah\nI never say never with you\n\nI never say never with you, I end up together with you\nIt's hell and it's heaven with you, baby\nAnything's possible, the highs are unstoppable\nIt's so uncontrollable, it's crazy\nWe say we won't and then we do\nYou're all I want, I never say never with you\nWe say we won't, but what's the use?\nBaby, come on, I'll never say never with you\nOh, no\nYou're all I want, I'll never say never with you\nOh, no, no, no, no, no\n\nI told my mama, I told my friends\nWhen it comes to her, when it comes to him, never again"}
