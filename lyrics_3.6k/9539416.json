(Taylor's Version) [From The Vault]", "artist": "Taylor Swift", "lyrics": "Got love-struck, went straight to my head\nGot lovesick all over my bed\nLove to think you\u2019ll never forget\nHandprints in wet cement\nAdorned with smoke on my clothes\nLovelorn and nobody knows\nLove thorns all over this rose\nI'll pay the price, you won't\n\nBut if I\u2019m all dressed up\nThey might as well be lookin' at us\nAnd if they call me a slut\nYou know it might be worth it for once\nAnd if I'm gonna be drunk\nI might as well be drunk in love\nSend the code, he's waitin' there\nThe sticks and stones they throw froze mid-air\nEveryone wants him, that was my crime\nThe wrong place at the right time\nAnd I break down, then he's pullin' me in\nIn a world of boys, he's a gentleman\n\nGot love-struck, went straight to my head (Straight to my head)\nGot lovesick all over my bed (Over my bed)\nLove to think you\u2019ll never forget\nWe\u2019ll pay the price, I guess\n\nBut if I'm all dressed up (If I\u2019m all dressed up)\nThey might as well be lookin' at us (Lookin' at us)\nAnd if they call me a slut (If they call me a slut)\nYou know it might be worth it for once (Worth it for once)\nAnd if I'm gonna be drunk\nI might as well be drunk in love\n\nHalf asleep\nTakin\u2019 your time in the tangerine\nNeon light, this is luxury\nYou're not sayin' you're in love with me\nBut you're goin' to\nHalf awake\nTakin' your chance, it's a big mistake\nI said, \"It might blow up in your pretty face\"\nI'm not sayin', \"Do it anyway\" (Do it anyway)\nBut you're going to\n\n(Up)\nAnd if they call me a (Slut)\nYou know it might be worth it for once\nAnd if I'm gonna be (Drunk)\nI might as well be drunk in love"}
