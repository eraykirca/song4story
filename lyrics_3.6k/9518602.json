Why you ain't in bed at home?\nThe stories that you tell about your lover sound too familiar\nIf he know what you did on your finsta, he'd try and kill you\nGirl, I'm a real gangster, I ain't goin' for shit\nEither we get it right or we can call it quits\n\nUh, and I know what I'm goin' through mean nothin' to you\nI would've did it all for your love, but my all ain't enough\nIt's safe to say, but I'm givin' up\nIs it anybody out there that got love for a thug?\nIs it love for a thug?\nIs it anybody out there that got love for a thug?\nIt's no love for a thug\nIs it anybody out there that got love for a thug?\nTell me, is it love for a thug?\nIs it anybody out there that got love for a thug?\nIt's no love for a thug\nFor a thug\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nIs it anybody out there?\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nThat thug life, that thug passion, you know what I'm saying?\nThat right or wrong, you know, forever rollin' and shit, you know what I'm saying?\nIs it love for a thug? Is it love for a thug?\nEven though I'm a thug, baby, I need love\nIs it anybody out there?\n\nGrrah"}
