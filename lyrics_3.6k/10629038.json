(Why would I let you in?)\nBut I think again\n\nI don't even try\nI don't have to think\nWith you, there's no pretending\n\nYou know me, you know me\nAnd I just might know you too, oh you\nCome to me ready\n\n(You make me wanna) Go dancing\n(You make me wanna) Try on feminine\n(You make me wanna) Go buy a new dress\n(You make me wanna) Slip off a new dress\n\nDon't ev\u0435n try\nI don't have to think\nWith you, there's no pr\u0435tending\n\nYou know me, you know me\nAnd I just might know you too, ooh you\nCome to me slowly"}
