My ex is a bachelor\nNext, gonna get big checks from the sets\nNext, from the dancers\nNext, from the models, this Hennessy is cursed\nSomeone hexed all the bottles (Someone hexed all the bottles)\nI swear on my life, I always try\nBut in my eyes, I can fly\nSigh\nBetter luck next time\n\nBe-be-better luck next time\nBetter luck next time\nBe-be-be-be-better luck next time\nBetter luck next time\nBe-be-be-be-better luck next time\nBetter luck next time\nBe-be-be-be-better luck next time\nBetter luck next time\n\nBe\u2014, be\u2014\nBe\u2014, be\u2014\nBe\u2014, be\u2014\nBe\u2014"}
