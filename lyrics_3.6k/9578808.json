(Lost out at sea)\nYou're not alone (Under the stars)\nDo you feel alone?\nYou're not alone\nAnd if they ask you, say you feel it\nBut don't call it love, Eusexua (Eusexua)\nDo you feel alone?\nNo, you're not alone\nAnd if they ask you, say you feel it\nBut don't call it love, Eusexua\nEusexua\n\nPeople always told me that I take my love too far\nThen refused to help me\nI was on the edge of something greater than before\nBut nobody told me\nEusexua"}
