Can I feel it? Can I feel it? Can I feel one?\nCan I feel it? Can I feel it? Can I feel?\n\nSometimes, I think to myself, \"What if I was somebody else?\"\nWould your ass still be here?\nWhat if I had a CDL leavin' outta STL\nOn the way to ATL in a big eighteen-wheel\nWould your ass still be here?\nWould your ass still be here?\nWould you love Ed like you love Drake?\nLove Fred like you love Drake?\nLove Greg like you love Drake?\nLove Ced like you love Drake?\nThought you said that you love Drake?\nThought you said that you love Drake?\nThought you said, ayy\nYour man brought you to the Drake show\nFront row and paid all cash\nDressed up to the nines, girls showin' all titties, showin' all ass\nLookin' at me like you're single, lookin' like you got a hall pass\nBetter take your ass home tonight and love that man like you say you love Drake\n\nI'm a well-known player, I'm a well-known trick\nI'm as well as well-known gets with a long list\nOf some ho-ho-hoes still waitin' on a gift\nGuess them ho-ho-hoes still believe in Saint Nick, yeah\nI'm a Saint, alright? I'll Franklin Saint a bitch\nI don't know what you thought this was, baby girl, but that ain't this\nI don't know who said you a slick\nNow my uncle, that boy slick\nI don't know who said you was thick\nNow see ****, that girl thick\nNah, I ain't name droppin', I'm just game droppin'\nI'm just plane hoppin'\nHoppin' out and hoppin' in\nYou gon' have to run that top again\nThese boys prayin' I don't drop again\n\nThis is Sade Adu\nAnd you're listening to BARK Radio"}
