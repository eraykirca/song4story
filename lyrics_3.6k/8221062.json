There were kids in the car\nWhat if you were remote? No one knows where you are\nIf you changed anything, would you not have survived?\nYou're alive, you're alive, you're alive\n\nAnd I know you don't remember calling me\nBut I told you even then you looked so pretty\nIn your hospital bed, I remember you said\nYou were scared\nAnd so am I"}
