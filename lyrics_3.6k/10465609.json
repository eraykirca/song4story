If he could see the way shit is today\n(Look at this shit, man) He'd probably say that everything is gay\n(Like happy!) What's my name, what's my name?\n\nSo, how many little kids still wanna act like me?\nI'm a bigger prick than cacti be\nAnd that's why these words sting, just like you were being attacked by bees\nIn the coupe leaning back my seat\nBumpin' R.
