Maybe when you\u2019re dead?\nMaybe you\u2019re a fool, but he loved you\nAnd he loved you in a t-shirt, mmm\nAll the memories inside your curves\nNow you\u2019re coming back to show us that girl\nSo roll those credits, 'cause the sequel\u2019s gonna hurt, mmm\n\nShow pony, make it burn\nSmile as the knife is turned\nShow pony making a return\nAs we make our way through the universe\nShow pony making it burn\nThat's how revenge is served\nMake it so cold that it hurts\nI guess he's right that you live and learn\n\nIt's how the story goes, ramen on your own\nWaiting by the phone, lipstick on the coat\nWaiting by the door, you live in his clothes\nYou would make a joke that you had none of your own\nAll that shit I learned from you\nKindness spilt like milk and juice\nSo blindsided by the truth\nIn some way I was sure you knew\n\nBut you don\u2019t, baby, you\u2019re alone\nEchoes in your head, pressed into the floor\nTwo-dimensional\nWhen\u2019s it gonna end? Maybe when you\u2019re dead?\nMaybe you\u2019re a fool, but he loved you\nAnd he loved you in a t-shirt, mmm\nAll the memories inside your curves\nNow you\u2019re coming back to show us that girl\nSo roll those credits, 'cause the sequel\u2019s gonna hurt, mmm\n\nShow pony, make it burn\nSmile as the knife is turned\nShow pony making a return\nAs we make our way through the universe\n\nAll those nights he left you and me\nThere was nothing left of you, but he squeezed\nAll those times he did what he pleased\nBoy, those scars must really run deep\nAnd all that hurt comes out in one scream\nAnd it pierced him like the paper receipt\nThat you got that time you went for food\nThat first night that he saw you\n\nShow pony, make it burn\nSmile as the knife is turned\nShow pony making a return\nAs we make our way through the universe\nShow pony making it burn\nThat's how revenge is served\nMake it so cold that it hurts\nI guess he's right that you live and learn"}
