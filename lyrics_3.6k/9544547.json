Misses, please pay my tab\nI heard life was a windin' road\nThere's no hounds or child around\nBut the Devil follows where I go\n\nWell, I've been comin' down on a Greyhound\nThat is westbound to the sea\nWhen you see the lights, when you hear the rain\nIs there a chance you're thinkin' of me?\nIs that song stuck in your head?\n\"Friend of the Devil\" by the Dead\nOr is that just what your friends want me to be?\nIf that's the case, then that's just what I'll be\n\nI've been comin' down on a Greyhound\nThat is westbound to the sea\nWhen you see the lights, when you hear the rain\nThere ain't a chance you're thinkin' of me\nIs that song stuck in your head?\n\"Friend of the Devil\" by the Dead\nOr is that just what your friends want me to be?\n'Cause if that's the case, then that's just what I'll be"}
