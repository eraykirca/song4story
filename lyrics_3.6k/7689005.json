I see that you're bleedin'\nYou don't need to show me again\nBut if you decide to, I'll ride in this life with you\nI won't let go 'til the end\n\nSo cry tonight\nBut don't you let go of my hand\nYou can cry every last tear\nI won't leave 'til I understand\nPromise me, just hold my hand\n\nRaise your head, look into my wishful eyes\nThat fear that's inside you will lift, give it time\nI can see everything you're blind to now\nYour prayers will be answered, let God whisper how\n\nTo tell me you need me, I see that you're bleedin'\nYou don't need to show me again\nBut if you decide to, I'll ride in this life with you\nI won't let go 'til the end\n\nSo cry tonight\nBut don't you let go of my hand\nYou can cry every last tear\nI won't leave 'til I understand\nPromise you'll just hold my hand\n\nHold my hand, hold my\u2014\nHold my hand, hold my hand\nI'll be right here, hold my hand\nHold my hand, hold my\u2014\nHold my hand, hold my hand\nI'll be right here, hold my hand\n\nI know you're scared and your pain is imperfect\nBut don't you give up on yourself\nI've heard a story, a girl, she once told me\nThat I would be happy again\n\nHold my hand, yeah\nHold my hand, oh yeah\nHold my hand, hold my hand\nHold my hand, hold my hand\nHold my hand\n\nI heard from the heavens"}
