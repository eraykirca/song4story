(Damn)\nDo you feel like you can't get on your knees and just pray to the Lord through the dark times? (Hold me)\nYou know what you need, I just need you to hold me (Hold me)\nListen and feel my heart closely\nI was down in too deep like an ocean (Splash)\nYou ain't the only one goin' through the motions (Motions)\nI was trapped up in all my emotions (Ha)\nLost my nephew to gunplay and smoke shit\nLost my dog to some petty-ass ho shit\nI guess you look at me 'cause I'm the oldest\nWe was the clos\u0435st (On God)\nI ain't never gon' let th\u0435 streets hold me (Streets)\nYou ain't never gon' hear that I folded (Never)\nIt's on me and I ain't got to show it\nI just gave it to God, told Him, \"Hold it\"\n\nMama, I want you to hold me\nTakeoff, promise, don't let me go\nHeaven, I want you to hold me\nLingo, don't let me go\nTree, I want you to hold me\nShara, promise, don't let me go\nJada, I want you to hold me\nJamie (Don't let me go)\n\nDo you feel like you can get through the hard times?\nLookin' right at the dark when the light shine\nI suggest you hold me\nWe live different lives and races\nAll in different places (Hold me)\nI need you to hold me\nIf you lost and you can't find it\nYou ain't the only one that's been cryin'\nJust pull up on me (Hold me)\nYeah, if you lost and you can't find it\nYou the only one that's been cryin'\nJust pull up on me (Hold me)\nI need you to hold me\n\nHold me\nDon't let me go\nWe supposed to be family\nHold me\nDon't let me go\nWe supposed to be family\nHold me\nDon't let me go\nSupposed to be fam, yeah\nHold me\nDon't let me go"}
