I find it hard to listen\nThey want it loud, they want it now, they want it now\nJust get it out, just get it out, just give it out\n\nHey, kid\nJust sing the songs that wake the dead then\nYou get that darkness out your head, yeah\nYou had it with you from the start\nThe lightning in your heart\n\nYeah, it's gonna take me out\nYeah, it's gonna bring me down\nBut I'm just living for the spirit now\n\nI'm out of luck on the floor, every siren's ringing\nIt's not the same anymore, I hear them trumpets singing\nThey want it loud, they want it now, they want it loud\nJust get it out, just get it out, just get it out\nAs much as everything changes, everything stays the same\nI've been going through phases, turning the page in my brain\nThat glow up ahead in the distance, it's never looking the same\nI'm going through changes, going through phases\nWalking through mazes, wrecking my brain, so\n\nHey, kid\nJust sing the songs that wake the dead then\nJust get that darkness out your head, yeah\nIt's the blessing and the curse\nThe dying and the birth\n\nYeah, it's gonna take me out\nYeah, it's gonna bring me down\nBut I'm just living for the spirit now\nI'm just living for the spirit now\nI'm just living for the spirit now"}
