Huh\n\nEvery night you been on my mind but all I find is nothing by the morning\nBy the morning\nAnd all that's left is the emptiness but no regrets 'cause you know that I want it\n\nWe'll do it all again when all the lights go down, 'til we both pass out\nThen we come back 'round\nWe'll do it all again when all th\u0435 lights go down, 'til we both pass out\nThen we com\u0435 back 'round\nOh, you know we'll do it all again\n\nAnd again\nAnd again\nWhen the lights go down, we'll do it all again\nAnd again\nAnd again\nOh, you know\n\nIt feels so innocent\n'Til we go back 'round in circles right back here again, yeah\nYou're my adrenaline\nIt should hurt so good and we should both be sick of it, huh\n\nEvery night you been on my mind but all I find is nothing by the morning\nBy the morning\nAnd all that's left is the emptiness but no regrets 'cause you know that I want it\n\nWe'll do it all again when all the lights go down, 'til we both pass out\nThen we come back 'round\nWe'll do it all again when all the lights go down, 'til we both pass out\nThen we come back 'round\nOh, you know we'll do it all again\n\nAnd again\nAnd again\nWhen the lights go down, we'll do it all again\nAnd again\nAnd again\nWhen the lights go down, we'll do it all again"}
