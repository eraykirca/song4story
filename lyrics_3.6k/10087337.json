Wait, what?)\n(Wait, what? Wait, what?)\n\nEarned my stripes, three hundred tracks in my Adidas track jacket\nBless your ear holes while you react, acting\nGobsmacked, don't hesitate\nTo maybe overcompensate\nI feel like I was just here, same twitchin' in my eyes\nDon't sleep on a boy who can't fall asleep twice\nIn the same night, and won't hesitate\nTo maybe overcompensate\n\nI said I fly by the dangerous bend symbol (Wait, what? Wait, what?)\nMm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate\nAnd then by the time I catch in my peripheral (Wait, what? Wait, what?)\nMm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate\n\nWhere am I from? I was born right here, just now\nOriginated right in front of your eyes\nIf you can't see, I am Clancy, prodigal son\nDone running, come up with Josh Dun, wanted dead or alive\nSo now you pick who you serve, you bow to the masses\nGet kicked to the curb for passin' the classes\nHalf empty, half full, save half for your taxes\nThen overtake your former self\n\nI fly by the dangerous bend symbol (Wait, what? Wait, what?)\nMm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate\nAnd then by the time I catch in my peripheral (Wait, what? Wait, what?)\nMm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate\n\nDays feel like a perfect length\nI don't need them any longer, but for goodness' sake\nDo the years seem way too short for my soul, coraz\u00f3n\nWay too short for my soul, coraz\u00f3n\nThe days feel like a perfect length\nI don't need them any longer, but for goodness' sake\nDo the years seem way too short for my soul, coraz\u00f3n\nWay too short for my soul, coraz\u00f3n\n\nEarned my stripes, three hundred tracks in my Adidas track jacket\nBless your ear holes while you react, acting\nGobsmacked, don't hesitate\nTo maybe overcompensate\n\nI said I fly by the dangerous bend symbol (Wait, what? Wait, what?)\nMm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate\nAnd then by the time I catch in my peripheral (Wait, what? Wait, what?)\nMm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate"}
