Why they come?\nWhy they come? Why they come?\n\nAnd why she losin' so much weight?\nI heard it's from the drugs she ate\nAnd I feel her, but I can't relate\n'Cause I'd never end up in that state\nA girl like that is a mother, must be tough\nA problem child, I was rough\nBut what do you do with a difficult grownup?\n\nWhen I die, I won't have time to spend my money\nBut I hope that you still love me (Da-da-da-da, da-da-mm)\n\n'Cause I'm so lucky (I'm so lucky), I'm a star\nBut I cry, cry, cry in my lonely heart, thinkin'\n\"If there's nothin' missin' in my life\nThen why do these tears come at night?\"\n\nI shaved my head four times because I wanted to\nAnd then I did it one more time 'cause I got sick (I am so lucky)\nAnd I thought I changed so much, nobody would notice it, and no one did\nThen I left the doctor's office full of tears\nBecame a single mom at my premiere\nAnd I told everybody I was fine for a whole damn year\nAnd that's the biggest lie of my career\n\nBut I'm so lucky, I'm a star\nBut I cry, cry, cry in my lonely heart, thinkin'\n\"If there's nothin' missin' in my life\nThen why do these tears come at night?\"\nI'm so lucky, I'm a star\nBut I cry, cry, cry in my lonely heart, thinkin'\n\"If there's nothin' missin' in my life\nThen why do these tears come at night?\"\n\nShe's so lucky, she's so lucky\nShe's so lucky, she's so\nHaven't you heard?"}
