Are you superstitious?\nAre you tapped inside the universe with energies and spirits?\nIt's family over everything, I swear I love them dearly\nI wonder, do they feel the same 'bout me?\nSometimes I wanna go back home, wonder how things'll be\nI'll leave rap alone if I can find th\u0435m things for cheap\n24/7 I'm ripping and running until I get lost in my feelings\nHate doing shows, but I lov\u0435 my fans and I'm loving all of these millions (Yeah), yeah\nAnd I love that girl to death, I wonder, can she feel it?\nSometimes I miss the past and how things were in the beginning\nAnd tell me, have you ever seen love? 'Cause I swear I didn't (Yeah)\nMama gave me love, but at least she tried her hardest\nFuck an opp nigga birthday, might pull up and crash the party\nI owe karma so many heartbreaks that it scarred me (You know what I'm sayin'? So I say)\n\nAnd the walls keep on whispering (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nI'm surprised you can hear it (Yeah)\nTell me, do you believe in love? Do you believe in karma? (Yeah)\nAre you superstitious? (Mm)\nThree hundred and sixty-five dope sales, that's a play a day\nCrack under my fingernails, only time I felt a way\nDo you believe in love? Do you believe in karma?\nAre you superstitious?\n\nTell me\nTell me, tell me\nTell me, tell me\nThree hundred and sixty-five dope sales, that's a play a day\nCrack under my fingernails, only time I felt a way\nOnly time I felt a way\nCould never make me feel a way\nOh, so I made it out that\nTell me, tell me"}
