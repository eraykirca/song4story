What's the password?\n\nI need humanity\nY'all lack humanity, drowning in vanity\nCraving humanity\nY'all lack humanity, I need humanity\nI need\u2013\n\nEverybody wanna be beautiful, scared of the unusual\nScared of givin' mutual respect, all that you hate\nYou reflect all that godlike, you forget how to love somebody\nI hate everybody, I hat\u0435 everyone\nL\u0435t's talk about A.I., robot got more heart than I\nRobot got future, I don't\nRobot get sleep, but I don't power down\nI'm wide open, I'm awake, I'm on autopilot\nI'm out of my mind and I'm wide open\n\nCan you distract me from all the disaster?\nCan you touch on me and not call me after?\nCan you hate on me and mask it with laughter?\nCan you lead me to the ark? What's the password?\n\nI need humanity\nY'all lack humanity, drowning in vanity\nCraving humanity\nY'all lack humanity, I need humanity\nI need\u2013\n\nYou said all of my friends are on my payroll\nYou're not wrong, you're an asshole\nScreaming at you in the Ludlow\nI was yours for free\nI don't get existential\nI just think about myself and look where that got me\nStandin' on my own in an airport bar or hotel lobby\nWaiting to feel clean\nThat's so fucking boring\n\nCan you distract me from all the disaster?\nCan you touch on me and not call me after?\nCan you hate on me and mask it with laughter?\nCan you lead me to the ark? What's the password?\n\nI need humanity\nY'all lack humanity, drowning in vanity\nCraving humanity\nY'all lack humanity, I need humanity\nI need\u2013\n\nThose who have forsaken their humanity\nThey like to patch their life with morality\nI think I might be tryna patch my life with morality\nI'm curious, I'm curious"}
