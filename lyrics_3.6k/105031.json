Won't you come?\n\nStuttering, cold and damp\nSteal the warm wind, tired friend\nTimes are gone for honest men\nAnd sometimes far too long for snakes\nIn my shoes, a walking sleep\nAnd my youth I pray to keep\nHeaven send Hell away\nNo one sings like you anymore\n\nBlack hole sun, won't you come\nAnd wash away the rain?\nBlack hole sun, won't you come?\nWon't you come?\nBlack hole sun, won't you come\nAnd wash away the rain?\nBlack hole sun, won't you come?\nWon't you come?\n\n(Black hole sun, black hole sun)\nWon't you come?\n(Black hole sun, black hole sun)\nWon't you come?\n(Black hole sun, black hole sun)\nWon't you come?\n(Black hole sun, black hole sun)\n\nHang my head, drown my fear\n'Til you all just disappear\n\nBlack hole sun (Black hole sun)\nWon't you come (Won't you come?)\nAnd wash away the rain?\nBlack hole sun (Black hole sun)\nWon't you come? (Won't you come?)\nWon't you come? (Won't you come?)\nBlack hole sun (Black hole sun)\nWon't you come (Won't you come?)\nAnd wash away the rain?\nBlack hole sun (Black hole sun)\nWon't you come? (Won't you come?)\nWon't you come? (Won't you come?)\n\n(Black hole sun, black hole sun)\nWon't you come?\n(Black hole sun, black hole sun)\nWon't you come?\n(Black hole sun, black hole sun)\nWon't you come?\n(Black hole sun, black hole sun)\nWon't you come?\n(Black hole sun, black hole sun)\nWon't you come?\n(Black hole sun, black hole sun)\nWon't you come?\nWon't you come?"}
