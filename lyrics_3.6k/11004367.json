(Oh no)\nI can't deny, no, when that feeling's right\nI bet you'll feel the way I do\n\nOh, your eyes are on me, I can feel the fire\nNot like anything that I've ever known\nMight be the one and only chance I'll get with you\nAnd I'll regret it if I take it too slow\n\nSomething in my body, something that's in my soul\nTells me you're somebody, someone I need to know\nNo, I can't leave here sorry, if I just let this go\nDon't wanna hear my heart say, \"I told you so\"\n\nDon't wanna hear my heart say, \"I told you so\"\n\nWalls have fallen, heart is all in\nThis is what it feels like\nWalls have fallen down\nAnd you know I won't fight\n\nI'm feeling something in my body, something that's in my soul\nTells me you're somebody, someone I need to know\nNo, I can't leave here sorry, if I just let this go\nDon't wanna hear my heart say, \"I told you so\" (I told you so)\n\nI told you, I, I, I told you so\nI told you, I, I, I told you so\nI told you, I, I, I told you so\nDon't wanna hear my heart say, \"I told you so\""}
