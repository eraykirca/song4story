I guess I was a shoulder to cry on\nA face on a lover with a fire in his heart\nA girl undercover, but you tore her apart\nMaybe this year, maybe this year\nI'll give it to someone special\n\nLast Christmas, I gave you my heart\nBut the very next day, you gave it away\nThis year, to save me from tears\nI'll give it to someone special\n'Cause last Christmas, I gave you my heart\nBut the very next day, you gave it away\nThis year, to save me from tears\nI'll give it to someone special\nLast Christmas\nLast Christmas\nThis year, to save me from tears\nI'll give it to someone special\n\nOoh\nHey\nI'll give it to someone special"}
