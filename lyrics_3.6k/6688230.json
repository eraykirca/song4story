Yeah\nI don't know what to say since th\u0435 twist of fate\nWhen it all broke down\nAnd th\u0435 story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now\n\nNext chapter\n\nHow'd we end up this way?\nSee me nervously pulling at my clothes and tryin\u2019 to look busy\nAnd you're doin' your best to avoid me\nI'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us\nHow I was losin' my mind when I saw you here\nBut you held your pride like you should've held me\n\nOh, I'm scared to see the ending\nWhy are we pretending this is nothin'?\nI'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how\nI've never heard silence quite this loud\n\nNow I'm standin' alone in a crowded room\nAnd we're not speakin'\nAnd I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you\nLike it's killin' me? Yeah\nI don't know what to say since the twist of fate\nWhen it all broke down\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now\n\nThis is looking like a contest\nOf who can act like they care less\nBut I liked it better when you were on my side\nThe battle's in your hands now\nBut I would lay my armor down\nIf you said you'd rather love than fight\n\nSo many things that you wish I knew\nBut the story of us might be ending soon\n\nNow I'm standin' alone in a crowded room\nAnd we're not speakin'\nAnd I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you\nLike it's killin' me? Yeah\nAnd I don't know what to say since the twist of fate\nWhen it all broke down\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now\nAnd we're not speakin'\nAnd I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you\nLike it's killin' me? Yeah\nI don't know what to say since the twist of fate\n'Cause we're goin' down\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now\n\nThe end"}
