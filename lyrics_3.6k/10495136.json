I think I'm okay\n\n'Cause, oh, my God, he walked in\nLike a 6'2'' dream Heaven sent\nHe says what he means, and he means what he says\nAnd he's funny and he's smart\nAnd he's good in \u2014 (Good in \u2014 )\nMaybe love ain't always what it was\nNot cryin' and dyin', and messin' me up\nI think I'm really happy, I think I wanna stay\nOh, my God, am I okay?\n\nI check my pulse and my heart's still beatin'\nExhale I think I'm still breathin'"}
