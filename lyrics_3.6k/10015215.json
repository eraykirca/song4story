Am I shapeable clay?\nOr is this as good as it gets?\nOne day, you're on top of the mountain\nSo high that you'll never come down\nThen the wind at your back carries ember and ash\nAnd burns your whole house to the ground\n\nIs it thought out at all or just paint on a wall?\nIs there anything that you regret?\nI don't understand, are there blueprints or plans?\nCan I speak to the architect?\n\nI thought that I was too broken\nAnd maybe too hard to love\nI was in a weird place, then I saw the right face\nAnd the stars and the planets lined up\n\nDoes it happen by chance? Is it all happenstance?\nDo we have any say in this mess?\nIs it too late to make some more space?\nCan I speak to the architect?\nThis life that we make, is it random or fate?\nCan I speak to the architect?\nIs there an architect?"}
