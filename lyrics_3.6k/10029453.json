Didn't we?\n\nSo I grab my stuff\nCourtney just pulled up in the driveway\nIt's time\n\nBye-bye\nBoy, bye\nBye-bye\nIt's over, it's over, oh, yeah\nBye-bye\nI'm takin' what's mine, yeah\nBye-bye\nIt's over, it's over, oh, yeah\n\nYou know? I'm stronger than I think\nUsually, I'd join you on the floor, but this dance ain't for me\nBoy, just turn the music up\nMaybe someday, we'll look back with love\nDidn't think you'd lose me\nNow it's just too late to choose me\n\nSo I grab my stuff\nCourtney just pulled up in the driveway\nIt's time (It's time)\n\nBye-bye\nBoy, bye (Boy, bye)\nBye-bye\nIt's over, it's over, oh, yeah\nBye-bye\nI'm takin' what's mine, yeah (Takin' what's mine)\nBye-bye\nIt's over, it's over, oh, yeah\n\nNow, it's certainly bittersweet\nThis hook feels too hard to sing\nBut it's better than repeat (Than repeat, than repeat, than repeat)\nOoh\n\nBye-bye (Bye-bye)\nBoy, bye (Boy, bye)\nBye-bye\nIt's over, it's over, oh, yeah (Bye)\nBye-bye (Bye-bye)\nI'm takin' what's mine, yeah (Takin' what's mine, ooh)\nBye-bye\nIt's over, it's over, oh, yeah (Ooh)\nBye-bye (Bye-bye)\nBoy, bye\nBye-bye\nIt's over, it's over, oh, yeah (It's over, baby)\nBye-bye (Bye-bye)\nI'm takin' what's mine, yeah (I'm takin' what's mine)\nBye-bye\nIt's over, it's over, oh, yeah"}
