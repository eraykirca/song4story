Would you leave you out to dry?\nWould you lie and say that runnin' don't cross your mind?\nAnd tell me, baby, would you drive you crazy?\nWhat would you do? What would you do to you?\nKnowin' you, you'd set the whole damn house on fire\nKnowin' you, you wouldn't let you make it out alive\n'Fore you blame me and tell me that you hate me\nWhat would you do? What would you to you?\n\n(What would you do to you?)\n(Oh)\n\nTell me honestly, if you practice honesty\nWould you tell the world that you're everythin' I thought you'd be?\nWould you take you back? Would you cut you loose?\nIf you were wearin' these boots, baby, what would you do to you?\n\nWould you love you? Would you leave you out to dry?\nWould you lie and say that runnin' don't cross your mind?\nAnd tell me, baby, would you drive you crazy?\nWhat would you do? What would you do to you?\nKnowin' you, you'd set the whole damn house on fire\nKnowin' you, you wouldn't let you make it out alive\n'Fore you blame me and tell me that you hate me\nWhat would you do? What would you do to you?\n\n(What would you do to you?)\n\nLookin' in your eyes, baby, I don't even see you\nRunnin around like you don't even wanna be you\nI know the story, baby, I want a confession\nI got one question, what would you do to you?\n\nWould you love you? Would you leave you out to dry?\nWould you lie and say that runnin' don't cross your mind?\nAnd tell me, baby, would you drive you crazy?\nWhat would you do? What would you do to you?\nKnowin' you, you'd set the whole damn house on fire\nKnowin' you, you wouldn't let you make it out alive\n'Fore you blame me and tell me that you hate me\nWhat would you do? What would you do to you?\n\n(What would you do to you?)\n(What would you do to you?)\n(What would you do to you?)\n(What would you do to you?)"}
