Do you?\nDo-do-do you? Do you?\nDo you? Do you?\nDo-do-do you? Do you?\nDo you? Do you?\nDo-do-do you? Do you?\nDo you? Do you?\nDo-do-do you? Do you?\nDo you? Do you?\nDo-do-do you? Do you?\nDo you? Do you?\nDo-do-do you? Do you?\n\nDo you think about the days when we sat down\nSmoking wine and drinking haze? Or\nWas it the other way?\nWas it the other way?\nSwing 'round, come on, chill with me\nI got your favourite show recorded on my TV, but\nWe don't have to watch that, no\nI'll turn off the radio"}
