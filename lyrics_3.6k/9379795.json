(Let's go, everybody go)\nWhen the rhythm is glad (C'mon, c'mon)\nThere is nothing to be sad (That's right, oh, that's right)\nDanger and dance (C'mon, c'mon)\nClapping the hands (Electric, electric)\nWhen we out in the space\nOn the planet of the bass\n\nLife, it never die\nWomen are my favorite guy\nSex, I'm wanting more\nTell the world, \"Stop the war\"\nBoom, hear the bass go zoom\nHave a body, feel the groove\nCyber system overload\nEverybody movement\n\nAll of the dream (Let's go, everybody go)\nHow does it mean? (Put your hands in the air right now)\nWhen the rhythm is glad (C'mon, c'mon)\nThere is nothing to be sad (Yeah, oh, yeah)\nDanger and dance (Ooh)\nClapping the hands\nWhen we out in the space\nOn the planet of the bass\n\nHello, are you at phone?\nYes, it's true, yes, it's true\nAre you the girl of the love?\nYes, I am a girl\nI love you and feel groove\nI love you too\nI want the sex on the phone\nI am so alone in the night\nGoodbye\nGoodbye\nAnd tonight, I will never die\nThat is good to me as well as that\nOh-oh, oh, la-di-da (Yeah, c-c'mon)\nLa-di-da-di-da (Tonight)\nAh-ah-ah (Yeah)\nOh-oh-oh-ooh-oh, yeah, yeah, yeah (Fun)"}
