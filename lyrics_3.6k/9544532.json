And I wanna try out\nFor the sev\u0435nth grade football team\nYou'll probably be nothin\u2019 but this town\u2019s old drunkard\nAnd die on a smoke-stained stool\nBut right now, he's got a bargain that he\u2019s taken too far\nOn his boy's game of nine-ball pool\n\nMy father was a bettin' man\nBut I got myself a steady hand\nHe's sittin\u2019 in the corner with a six-pack of Corona\nBettin' that his son'll win again\nMy father was a bettin' man\n\nMy father was a bettin' man\nBut I got myself a steady hand\nHe's sittin' in the corner with a six-pack of Corona\nBettin' that his son'll win again\n\nI don't wanna bet, but my daddy wrote a check\nThat I bet his ass could never cash\nHe's bettin' on the eight ball landin' in the side wall\nCold-blooded killer if you ask"}
