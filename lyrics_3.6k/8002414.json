(Lie)\nShe know I do not care for no pressin' my mind\nThe federal skeleton on my wrist say prime-time (Time)\nHow couldn't you just let me be me?\nYou starting to be measly (Measly)\nI couldn't even find out 'cause you leavin' me\nYou can tell I'm pure, you can feel my energy (Energy)\nReally rich, we ain't living free\nGot to keep it solid, and we all agree\n\nHow am I free when you hold me so tight?\nHow can I beam when you blocking my light?\nI cannot be what you want me\nWhat you want me, what you want me to be\nHow can I see when you cover my eyes?\nAnd can I just sleep when I'm so fucking tired?\nSo tell me right now what you want me\nWhat you want me, what you want me to be\n\nOoh, ah, ah, ah, ah"}
