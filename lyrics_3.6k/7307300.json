Woah\nShaking and moving, like, what am I doing?\nI'm flipping my time through the Rolodex\nIndulging myself in my life and my music\nThe world that I'm in is a cul-de-sac\nThe world that we in is just menacing\nThe demons portrayed as religionous\nI wake in the morning, another appointment\nI hope the psychologist listenin'\n\nThe new Mercedes whip, black G-Wagon\nThe, \"Where you from?\" It was all for rap\nI was 28 years young, twenty mill' in tax\nBought a couple of mansions, just for practice\nFive hundred in jewelry, chain was magic\nNever had it in public, late reaction\n50K to cousins, post a caption\nPray none of my enemies hold me captive\n\nI grieve different\nI grieve different, huh\n\nI met her on the third night of Chicago\nNorth America tour, my enclave\nFee-fi-fo-fum, she was a model\nDedicated to the songs I wrote and the Bible\nEyes light green penetratin' the moonlight\nHair done in a bun, energy in the room like\nBig Bang for theory, God, hopin' you hear me\nPhone off the ringer, tell the world, \"I'm busy\"\nFair enough, green-eyes said her mother didn't care enough\nSympathize when her daddy in the chain gang\nHer first brother got killed, he was twenty-one\nI was nine when they put Lamont in the grave\nHeartbroken when Estelle didn't say goodbye\nChad left his body after we FaceTimed\nGreen-eyes said you'd be okay, first tour, sex'd the pain away\n\nI grieve different\nI grieve different, huh\n\nThe new Mercedes whip, black G-Wagon\nThe, \"Where you from?\" It was all for rap\nI was 28 years young, twenty mill' in tax\nBought a couple of mansions, just for practice\nFive hundred in jewelry, chain was magic\nNever had it in public, late reaction\n50K to cousins, post a caption\nPray none of my enemies hold me captive\n\nSo what? Paralyzed, the county building controlled us\nI bought a Rolex watch, I only wore it once\nI bought infinity pools I never swimmed in\nI watched Keem buy four cars in four months\nYou know the family dynamics on repeat\nThe insecurities locked down on PC\nI bought a .223, nobody peace treat\nYou won't doo-doo me, I smell TNT\nDave got him a Porsche, so I got me a Porsche\nPaid lottery for it, I ain't want it in portions\nPoverty was the case\nBut the money wipin' the tears away\n\nI grieve different\n(Everybody grieves different)\n(Everybody grieves different)\nI grieve different, huh"}
