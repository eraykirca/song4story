What country am I in?\nIt doesn't matter, it's five o'clock somewhere\nIt's always on five in Margaritaville, come to think of it\nYeah, I heard that\nYou been, there haven't you?\nYessir\nI seen your boat there\nI've been to Margaritaville a few times\nAlright, that's good\nStumbled all the way back\nOkay, just wanna make sure you can keep it between the navigational beacons\nHa ha ha ha, between the buoys, I tell you\nAlright. Well, it's five o'clock. Let's go somewhere\nI'm ready, crank it up\nLet's get out of here\nI'm gone"}
