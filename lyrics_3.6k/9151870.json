Yeah\n\nStill use cash with the card on file\nCheck what you drinkin', they water it down\nSaid what you said, you a part of it now\nChance after chance, I done gave you a pound\nFeds on your ass, gotta bury it now\nI popped a Addy, I barely pronounce\nEyeball the weed and it's barely a ounce\nWatch how you speak, you could bury your spouse\nBro, I got M's and I slept on the couch\nAin't got a bond, it got inherit amount\nMy budget two million, the killers is out\nI get my teeth from the Mouth of the South\nGot the location, you not in your house\nHow do it feel to have Glocks in your mouth?\nI know you broke 'cause they froze your account\nFeel like a goofy promotin' the clown\nI told my lawyer I'm sober now\nRun up a check 'cause I'm older now\nGot who we want, so it's over now\nHow you slide, but ain't nobody vouch?\nCounterfeit money, ain't nobody count\nHow you think I got two hundred pounds?\nFifties, fifties, fifties, two hundred rounds\nOut of jail early, you know that he foul\nNike ski mask to cover the brows\nNo Auto, pain, I got a couple of styles\nI done paid for a couple of trials\nI done slaid me a couple of dials\nCall her now 'cause I ain't fuck in a while\nI got love for bro, he holdin' me down\nFrrt, hold a couple of rounds\nFrrt, standin' over him now, yeah\n\nI'm so high off this X pill\nI don't give no fuck how my ex feel\nYour new nigga ain't put you on no jet still\nWhy send shots like he a threat? Yeah"}
