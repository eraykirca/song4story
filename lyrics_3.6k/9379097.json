I can't imagine ever doing all that stuff for just some guy\nLike, you're just some guy\nOh, but I hope that you're happy, babe, you know I really do\nAnd God knows that I am the girl I am because of you\nYou know I'll always think of you, I'll love ya 'til the end of time\nYou are the best thing that I'll ever keep so far out of my life\n\nYeah, I was half myself without you and now I feel so complete\nI can't even remember what made me lose all that sleep\nI cried a million rivers for you, but that's over now\nYou're just a stranger I know everything about, ooh, ooh\nYou're just a stranger I know everything about\n\nThere's nothin' left for me to know\nI had to stay, you had to go\nAnd it was mean, but it doesn't matter anymore, though\nThere's nothin' left for me to sing\nI screamed, I cried, I did the whole thing\nAnd I loved you mad, but it doesn't matter anymore, no\n\nI was half myself without you, now I feel so complete\nAnd if I'm not enough for you, you're not enough for me\nI fought a million battles, but you can't get to me now\nYou're just a stranger I know everything about, ooh, ooh\nYou're just a stranger I know everything about\nYou're just a stranger I know everything about"}
