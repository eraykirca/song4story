(Of success)\nListening to what your heart says (Your heart says)\nStanding up for what you know is (Is)\nRight, while everybody else is (Is)\nTucking their tail between their legs (Okay)\nWhat's my definition of success? (Of success)\nCreating something no one else can (Else can)\nBeing brave enough to dream big (Big)\nGrinding when you're told to just quit (Quit)\nGiving more when you got nothing left (Left)\nIt's a person that'll take a chance on\nSomething they were told could never happen\nIt's a person that can see the bright side\nThrough the dark times when there ain't one\nIt's when someone who ain't never had nothin'\nAin't afraid to walk away from\nMore profit 'cause they'd rather do somethin'\nThat they really love and take the pay cut\nIt's a person that would never waver\nOr change who they are\nJust to try and gain some credibility\nSo they could feel accepted by a stranger\nIt's a person that can take the failures in their life and turn them into motivation\nIt's believing in yourself when no one else does, it's amazin'\nWhat a little bit of faith can do if you don't even believe in you\nWhy would you think or expect anybody else that's around you to?\nI done did things that I regret, I done said things I can't take back\nWas a lost soul at a crossroad who had no hope, but I changed that\nI spent years of my life holdin' on to things I never should've kept, full of hatred\nYears of my life carryin' a lot of baggage that I should've walked away from\nYears of my life wishin' I was someone different, lookin' for some validation\nYears of my life tryna fill the void, pretending I was in\u2014\nThey get it\n\nGrowing pain's a necessary evil\nDifficult to go through, yes, but beneficial\nSome would say having a mental breakdown is a negative thing\nWhich on one hand, I agree with\nOn the other hand, it was the push I needed\nTo get help and start the healing process, see if\nI'd have never hit rock bottom, would I be the person that I am today? I don't believe so\nI'm a prime example of what happens when you choose to not accept defeat and face your demons\nTook me thirty years to realize that if you wanna get that opportunity to be the\nGreatest version of yourself, sometimes you got to be someone you're not to hear the voice of reason\nHaving kids will make you really take a step back and look in the mirror, at least for me, that's what it did, I\n\nWake up every day and pick my son up, hold him in my arms and let him know he's loved (Loved)\nStanding by the window, questioning if Dad is ever going to show up (Up)\nIsn't something he's gon' have to worry 'bout, don't get it twisted, that wasn't a shot\nMama, I forgive you, I just don't want him to grow up thinkin' that he'll never be enough\nThirty years of running, thirty years of searchin'\nThirty years of hurting, thirty years of pain\nThirty years of fearful, thirty years of anger\nThirty years of empty, thirty years of shame\nThirty years of broken, thirty years of anguish\nThirty years of hopeless, thirty years of (Hey)\nThirty years of never, thirty years of maybe\nThirty years of later, thirty years of fake\nThirty years of hollow, thirty years of sorrow\nThirty years of darkness, thirty years of (Nate)\nThirty years of baggage, thirty years of sadness\nThirty years of stagnant, thirty years of chains\nThirty years of anxious, thirty years of suffering\nThirty years of torment, thirty years of (Wait)\nThirty years of bitter, thirty years of lonely\nThirty years of pushing everyone away ('Way)\n(You'll never evolve) I know I can change\n(We are not enough) We are not the same\n(You don't have the heart) You don't have the strength\n(You don't have the will) You don't have the faith\n(You'll never be loved, you'll never be safe)\n(Might as well give up) Not running away\n(You don't have the guts) You're the one afraid\n(I'm the one in charge) I'm taking the\u2014 (No)\nI'm taking the\nReins"}
