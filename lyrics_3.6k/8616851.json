Will you hang m\u0435 out to dry?\n\nMissin' my daddy when the nights get cold\nWishin' I didn't wanna sell my soul\nWishin' that it wasn't so hard, man, I'm on my knees\n\nGet a rise out of watchin' you fall\nGet a kick out of missin' your call\nI hate me enough for the two of us\nHate that I can't let go of you enough, this why\nI fuck him 'cause I miss you\nI fuck him 'cause I really miss you\nI fuck him 'cause I miss you\n\nI'm lookin' for comfort, I knew all along\nI knew that you loved her, since we droppin' bombs\nI fuck him 'cause I miss you\nI fuck him 'cause I really miss you\nI fuck him to forget you\nI fuck him 'cause I miss you\nI fuck him 'cause I miss you\nI try to run, but I don't block 'em\nFuck 'em, but I don't cuff 'em\nI fuck 'em 'cause I miss you"}
