(I don't know)\n(You could play it loud?)\n\nCrib by the beach like Ordell\nNo Beaumont, my killers don't tell\nChateau Marmont grabbed the Louis off the shelf\nNow my bitch addicted to Chanel\n\nWill you be my leading lady?\nI want a contract, girl, no maybe\nIn the meantime (I guess I'm doing what I want)\nGet some me-time (I don't know)\n(Hope you doing what you want)\n\nMy new bitch look like Halle Berry\nBut she don't love me, she too scary\nMy old bitch fine like Jackie Brown"}
