You're really just my enemy (Ayy)\nBreakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy\nAnd I don't wanna die-I don't-I don't wanna die young and\u2014\n\nI don't wanna die young that might make mama crazy\nNo ocean I'm too wavy\nNo therapy could save me\nTook L's been winnin' lately\nLocked in ain't no escapin'\nSometimes I get impatient\nMask on, no face no, cases, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nFall back, baby I gotta breathe\nFear nobody, I'm ready to bleed\nAnd she for the streets, she not for me\nFrom a place where they never believe\nIn the hood, thought I never would leave\nLike, what would you do if you run into me?\nGrab the choppa and you better squeeze\nHad no knock as he bob and he weave\nIf I go better follow my lead\nI still make it hot, like a hunnid degrees\nShow no love 'cause it's hard to receive\nYou seen what I seen then you'd probably agree\nCops and robbers, I'm playin' the thief\nAnd mama told me not to play in these streets\nIt's too late 'cause l'm playin' for keeps\n\nSo I'm lookin' through my memories, fallin' into jealousy\nHow can I miss you? You're really just my enemy (I don't wanna die young)\nBreakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy\nAnd I don't wanna die, I don't-I don't wanna die young and\u2014\n(I don't wanna die young) So I'm lookin' through my memories, fallin' into jealousy\nHow can I miss you? You\u2019re really just my enemy (I don't wanna die young)\nBreakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy\nAnd I don't wanna die-I don't-I don't wanna die young and\u2014\n\nDamn\nSo I'm\u2014\nDamn\nI don't wanna die young and\u2014\nSo I'm\u2014"}
