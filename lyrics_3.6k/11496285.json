(Happened to me)\nI must have fallen down a thousand times\nWhy am I like this? There's no way to hide this from anyone\nIt was anything but typical\nHow it all happened to me (Happened to me)\nI can't believe that I could be so blind, I had to find it\nNow I am reminded of everything\n\nI already know your name\n\nI will not break this time\nI know that vengeance will at last be mine\nI will not break this time\nI know that v\u0435ngeance will at last be min\u0435\nTime is ticking away, ticking away\nIf I can leave the past behind that's been crippling me, sickening me\n\nI will not break\n\nWhy am I acting like an animal?\nWhat the hell happened to me? (Happened to me)\nI've had enough of feeling terrified\nNow I'm deciding that I won't be hiding from anyone\nThe change was far beyond physical\nWhen it all happened to me (Happened to me)\nI even contemplated suicide\nAnd though I am haunted, I will not be taunted by anyone\n\nI already know your game\n\nI will not break this time\nI know that vengeance will at last be mine\nI will not break this time\nI know that vengeance will at last be mine\nTime is ticking away, ticking away\nIf I can leave the past behind that's been crippling me, sickening me\n\nI will not break\nI will not break\n\nI will not break\nI will not break\nI will not break\nI will not break\n\nI will not break this time\nI know that vengeance will at last be mine\nI will not break this time\nI know that vengeance will at last be mine\nTime is ticking away (Ticking away)\nI will not break this time\nI know that vengeance will at last be mine\nI will not break this time\nI know that vengeance will at last be mine\nTime is ticking away, ticking away\nIf I can leave the past behind that's been crippling me, sickening me\n\nI will not break\nUh-uh\nI will not break"}
