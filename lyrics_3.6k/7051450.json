Back?\n\nLove me, then you switch up\nI'd rather we never pick up\nBut can we slip up and mix up sometimes?\nYou say you don't mean it, just want it when it's convenient\nAm I crazy for waiting? I might slide\n\nNow you calling me special\nWhen you know I can't have you\nWhen I'm on to the next one\nOh, now you wan' get aggressive\nOh, fuck do you mean?\nYou keep on making me leave\nNightmares turned into a dream\nIf you're so toxic to me, what am I fiending?\n\n'Cause I thought it was over\nGot me thinking my feelings over\nYou keep doing it over and over\nYou keep calling me back\nI'm just tryna get closure\nBut you pulling me closer and closer\nPhone ringing, like, over and over\n'Cause you keep calling me back\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la\nWhy you keep calling me back? Back?\n\nNow you walking on a thin line\nWe been through it, like, ten times\nI'ma put you in line\nYeah, I had you on a incline\nNow I don't even wanna reply\nI'ma have to decline\n\n(Yeah) You show me I don't wanna rewind\n(Yeah) Know you a ten, but that attitude ain't fine"}
