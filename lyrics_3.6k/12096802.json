Why I just can't get it right?\nI pray at night to fix my life\nIf I be headed to the mornin', I talk to God, why I fly\nI'm a piece of shit, shorty, you could find you someone better\nShe'll never say that I'm that nigga once, ever mislead her\nGrandma gone, now I don't look at life as treasure\nI been tryna find my mama up inside you 'cause you special\nOh, I noticed that I'm gettin' older, it ain't gettin' no warmer\nI'm stuck in a storm, I'm tryna warm up\nAnd her friends tried to warn her\nAnd I know I might die on the corner\nThis shit been hard, thug\n\nLife hard, ain't been that easy\nShe wanna see me, but things ain't goin' right\nAnd I know, when time pass in a flash, I'ma get my money right\nYou been holdin' on and I admire your strength\nI'm tryna figure where the good times went"}
