I'm shackled in these chains\nI'm haunted by the lies of every time I said I'd change\nI'm slippin' through the shadows, it's weighing on my soul\nThe lights are shinin' on me, but there ain't nobody home\n\nOn my knees, I'm lookin' up\nI need a different kind of drug\n\nI'm wide awake and I'm dreamin'\nWonderin' where and when I fell apart\nOh, I fell apart\nI had enough of my demons\nAngels only meet you where you are\nAnd I'm in the dark\n'Least for now, Lord, I ain't losin' hope\nThat somehow you can make a heart of gold\nFrom this heart of stone, this heart of stone\nThis heart of stone\n\n'Cause I'm wide awake and I'm dreamin'\nWonderin' where and when I fell apart\nOh, I fell apart\nI had enough of my demons (Ooh)\nBut angels only meet you where you are\nAnd I'm in the dark (Oh)\nAt least for now, Lord, I ain't losin' hope\nThat somehow you can make a heart of gold\nFrom this heart of stone\nThis heart of stone\nThis heart of stone\n'Cause I'm wide awake and I'm dreamin'"}
