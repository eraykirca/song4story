You on a roll\nYou hit the splits and get naked, girl, you're on a roll\nYou payin' the rent these days and the groceries, woah\nLuckily, I got rich after that\nLuckily, you still my bitch after that\nLuckily, you went platinum like plaques\n\nCall me from the condo, I'm picking you up\nYou and I know, I know you deserve it\nIf I brought your birthday, you turnin' it up (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah)\nLast week, you gave me the sickest threesome (Oh yeah)\nThis week, you gave me the sickest head\nLast night, you tried to blow my mind (Ooh, yeah)\nAnd tonight, you tried to do it again, oh, woah\n\nYour mind and your body is outta control (Yeah)\nThe fuck was they thinking? You vulnerable, yeah (Okay)\nYou got them Liz Taylor diamonds and a heart of gold (Yeah)\nYou got that big ol' crib now and the sign says \"Sold\" (Ayy)\nWe're face to face in the crowd\nLaughin' over shots, people eyein' us down\nSame night, word is goin' 'round town\nThat kind of word can really get around\nThat can make a lost love come unfound\nYour ex needs to turn that frown upside down\nSmile and keep it pushin' before it goes south\nCan you come home with me tonight, are you allowed?\nI know you got the kids at the house\nPay the nanny double and come roll with the owl\nYou'll be back in time to make 'em breakfast, no doubt\nJust stay the night with me, get nasty\n\nCall me from the condo, I'm picking you up\nYou and I know, I know you deserve it\nIf I brought your birthday, you turnin' it up (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah)\nLast week, you gave me the sickest threesome (Oh yeah)\nThis week, you gave me the sickest head\nLast night, you tried to blow my mind (Ooh, yeah)\nAnd tonight, you tried to do it again, oh, woah"}
