(It was gettin' late)\nI'm goin' home\nI'll figure it out\nMaybe one day you'll feel the same\nWoah, oh-oh, oh-oh (Get my mind off you)\nWhere'd you go? (It was gettin' late)\nI'm goin' home\nI'll figure it out\nMaybe one day you'll feel the same\n\nI wish that I could snap my finger\nLa-la-la-la-la\nWish that I could, wish that I could\nLa-la-la-la\nWish that I could snap my finger\nLa-la-la-la-la\nWish that I could, wish that I could\nLa-la-la-la\n\nI left my room and I know I left too soon, it's over\nI wait for you\nLa-la-la-la-la\nI'm gettin' sick\nIt's the feelin' I got when I saw the train that I missed (That I missed)\nLa-la-la-la-la\nI got the next one 'cause you chose not to save me\nBy drivin' me instead like I had asked you to\n\nYou're gettin' pissed\nI'm hangin' around 'cause I know maybe one day you'll feel the same\n\nWoah, oh-oh, oh-oh (Get my mind off you)\nWhere'd you go? (It was gettin' late)\nI'm goin' home\nI'll figure it out\nMaybe one day you'll feel the same\nWoah, oh-oh, oh-oh (Get my mind off you)\nWhere'd you go? (It was gettin' late)\nI'm goin' home\nI'll figure it out\nMaybe one day"}
