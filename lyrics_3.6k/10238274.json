Do you want lust?\nSay you don't know\nMaybe you just like the control, like it all cold\nBut I like ya, like ya like you're drugs\nSit in my blood, maybe too much, never enough\nI am your dog, I'm on your floor, all that you want\nBut I like ya, like ya like you're (drugs)\n\nYou get all worked up\nLoving you, but it's not enough\nLoving you from the airlock of\nYour heart, from airlock one\nFear pulls you from my arms\nIt's a reckless abandon\nOne look and it's all gone\nAll the air from the bottom of my lungs\n\nWater, running down my face\nWater, running different ways\nWater, like a billion waves\nWater, just a tear in space\nWater, running down my face\nWater, running different ways\nWater, like a billion waves\nWater, just a tear in space\n\nOoh, too late, my love\nYou blew me into star dust\nOoh, but I made it, just\nDangling like a thread from you\nI climb into your walls\nI'm where the spiders go\nI'm here, but you aren't sure\nWhat are you waiting for?\nStretch me like leather rope\nMake me invisible\nShape me into your form\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\nHostage, so in love\nIt's an airless black-chasm\nYou turn the airlock on\nYou turn the airlock on\nObject disappearance\nIt's a true phenomenon\nForget me and I'm gone\nI'm slipping, no-no-no-no-no\n\nWater, running down my face\nWater, running different ways\nWater, like a billion waves\nWater, just a tear in space\nWater, running down my face\nWater, running different ways\nWater, like a billion waves\nWater, just a tear in space"}
