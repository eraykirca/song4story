What's wrong, Mr. Man?\nYour eyes are low\nAnd you're walking with both hands on your head\nHis response, he's on a clean, clean high\nBoth feet up on the ground\nBut his head's way, way, way in the sky (Sky)\n\nThe Black Seminole, a head general\nDistant connections, a large interval\nA black man with mouths to feed\nEmbracing equality throughout greed (Ha)\n\nNo time to joke around, the kid is now a man\nAnd the silence is filled with remarkable sounds\nThis part, I've seen in my dreams\nLove is not a lie, it just feels like a Tarantino movie scene\n\nFeel it\nExactly\n\nNow\nOoh,Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-hey\nAh, ah, ah, ee, whoa-hey\nOoh-ooh, o, h\nMm, mm, ooh, ooh-huh, ah, yeah\nEe, ee, yeah, uh-huh"}
