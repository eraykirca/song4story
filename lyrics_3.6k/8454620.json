But I gotta keep it goin'\nKnow the time I'm on demon, like fuck Halloween, turn this bitch to a horror story\nThrow away the receipt, I ain't never gon' need it, I'm never returnin' nothin'\nKinda big for Miami, let's hit the Maldives, we can wake up in Bora Bora\nWhen you see me, you speak, I got hittas with me but they know how to keep it cordial\nIf it's me, then it's me but I feel like it's you, let me know how you wanna do it\nI be goin' hard when I feel it, when I involve my dealings\nThis is how we gon' live\nForeign automobiles, six carats each ear\nHide your pain, gettin' dripped\nGive a damn how they feel\nThis is my life, I gotta live it\nI'm the one and I'll admit it\nSpendin' racks in every city\nDover Street, all way to Lenox\nI provide them with drip\nWalk right back 'em, I'm still\nAnd when you ready to go to sleep\nYou can put it all on me\nGot a lil' time, you wanna talk, you can just call on me\nAin't no days off for me, ain't no fallin' off for me\nIf I'm too much then my bad\nIf you ain't really on that then don't play like that\nIt's hard to leave, I done ran off for weeks\nSay you gon' fall for me then fall for me like autumn leaves\nTryna lay off of me\nYou off of me, I'm like, \"Shawty, please\"\nThen I'm like, \"Shawty, please\"\nNever mind, shawty, please\n\nYou got it, I want it, uh-huh\nKnow you need some love, attention\nI'm 'bout it, let's get it, let's go\nKnow your heart is not for breakin'\nI be, I'll be, I'll be it\nWon't you gon' be my lil' baby, stop playin'\nStop playin', stop playin', yeah, yeah"}
