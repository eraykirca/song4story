Treated me like a slave\nPromise you I'll behave if you let me try again\nFor you, I'd change my name\nFor you, I'd kill my fame\nFor you, I'd be so different, won't recognize my face\nCan't wait to go to my grave for you\nAll I'd care for you, you never saw me for me\nSaw me for me, loved me for me\n\nLoved me for me, saw me for me\nYou never loved me for me, saw me for me\nYou never saw me for me, loved me for me\n\nOne step from who I\u2019m tryna be\nCloser the more I accept me\nSaid I\u2019m drowning, rescue me\nOoh-ooh-ooh\nOne step from who I'm tryna be\nCloser the more I accept me\nSaid I\u2019m drowning, rescue me\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh-ooh\nOoh, love me, love me\nIt's time to love me for me\nOh, now I'm tryna love me for me, love me for me\nOoh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh\n(I'd end up tryna love me for me, love me for me)\nAh-ah, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh"}
