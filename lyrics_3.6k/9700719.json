I'm your lifeline\nThese bitches always checkin' for m\u0435 like a Nike sign\nNiggas always frontin' when th\u0435y only did some light time\n\nBeep, beep, beep, is that bleep?\nIs that you talkin' to me? It's that deep?\nIf I don't even know you exist, is that beef?\nWhen niggas get their jaw broke, wait, is that teeth?\n\nMurda, murda, murda, murda, mm (Murda)\nMurda, murda, murda, murda, mm (Murda)\nMurda, murda, murda, murda, mm (Murda)\nMurda, murda, murda, murda\n\nWait, is that teeth?"}
