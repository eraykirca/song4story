Now tell me, what is truth?\n(What you gonna do?) Have we all lost sight\n(What you gonna do?) Of common decency?\n(What you gonna do?) Of wrong and right?\nHow do we heal this great divide?\nDo we care enough to try?\nBut liar, liar, the world's on fire\nWhat we gonna do when it all burns down?\n\nBilly got a gun, Joey got a knife\nJanie got a sign to carry in the fight\nMarchin' in the streets with sticks and stones\nDon't you ever believe words don't break bones\n\nOh, can't we rise above?\nCan't we show some love?\nDo we just give up or make a change?\nWe know all too well\nWe've all been through hell\nTime to break the spell in Heaven's name\n\nLiar, liar, the world's on fire\nWhat you gonna do when it all burns down?\nFire, fire, burnin' higher (Fire, fire)\nStill got time to turn it all around\nLiar, liar, the world's on fire\nWhat you gonna do when it all burns down?\nFire, fire, burnin' higher\nStill got time to turn it all around\n\n(Liar, liar, the world's on fire)\n(What you gonna do when it all burns down?)\n(Liar, liar, the world's on fire)\n(What you gonna do when it all burns down?)\nShow some love (Fire, fire, the world's on fire)\n(Still got time to turn it all around)\nLet's rise above (Liar, liar, the world's on fire)\n(What you gonna do when it all burns down?)\nLet's make a stand (Liar, liar, the world's on fire)\n(What you gonna do when it all burns down?)\nLet's lend a hand (Liar, liar, the world's on fire)\n(Still got time to turn it all around)\nLet's heal the hurt (Liar, liar, the world's on fire)\n(What you gonna do when it all burns down?)\nLet kindness work (Liar, liar, the world's on fire)\n(What you gonna do when it all burns down?)\nLet's be a friend (Liar, liar, the world's on fire)\n(What you gonna do when it all burns down?)\nLet hatred end (Liar, liar, the world's on fire)\n(What you gonna do?)\nLiar, liar, the world's on fire\nWhat you gonna do when it all burns down?\nLiar, liar, the world's on fire\nWhat you gonna do when it all burns down?"}
