How could it be?\n\nThere is somethin' between us\nBetween me and you\nThere is somethin' between us\nI see right through, I see right through\n\nI had a version of home, and just like that\nI was left to live without it, left to live without it\nI had a person I loved, and just like that\nI was left to live without him, left to live without him\n\nWaitin' for the storm to pass\nWaitin' on this side of the glass\nBut I see my reflection in you, see your reflection in me\nHow can it be? How can it be?\n\nThere is somethin' between us\nBetween me and you\nThere is somethin' between us\nI see right through, I see right through\n\nThere is somethin' between us\nBetween me and you\nThere is somethin' between us\nI see right through, I see right through\n\nI had a vision of you, and just like that\nI was left to live without it, left to live without it\nWaitin' on this side of the glass"}
