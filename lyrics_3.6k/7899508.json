Ain't like it's got a place to be\nKeeps rushin' me\n\nBut I ignore things and I move sideways\n'Til I forget what I felt in the first place\nAt the end of the day, I know there are worse ways to stay alive\n\n'Cause everyone's growing and everyone's healthy\nI'm terrified that I might never have met me\nOh, if my engine works perfect on empty\nI guess I'll drive\n\nAnd if all my life was wasted\nI don't mind, I'll watch it go\nYeah, it's better to die numb than feel it all\nOh, if all my time was wasted\nI don't mind, I'll watch it go\nYeah, it's better to die numb than feel it all\n\nBut I ignore things and I move sideways\nUntil I forget what I felt in the first place\nAt the end of the day, Lord knows there are worse ways to stay alive\n\n'Cause everyone's growing and everyone's healthy\nI'm terrified that I might never have met me\nOh, if my engine works perfect on empty\nI guess I'll drive\nI guess I'll drive"}
