Can I still make a stack on my brilliance?\nI don't wanna go back to civilian status\nI'm an addict for comfort and doin' whatever I want to\nWhenever I wanna, I promise myself I would never feel hunger again\nSo I'm here with this pen, lockin' the fuck back in\nI'm from a rough past, for a quick dollar they poppin' your hubcap rims, profit is just that slim\nI was a rugrat when we had it the toughest and I had a hunch back then\nThat I was special, I gotta move careful, 'cause niggas 'round here they don't wrestle\nNo reason to tussle, reach down with a pistol, was down, so put one in your freckles\nHe was talkin' that shit, then he saw a lil' stick, all of the sudden he feelin' forgetful\nConnectin' to God, I'm a vessel\nWhen they ask for the old you, ignore 'em\nGoin' backwards is borin', bitch, and I'm not Michael Jordan, I don't do the retro\nUh, ayy, tell 'em again like an echo\nMy niggas ain't Greek, they pledgin' the streets, they come through and kick in your backdoor\nUsed to cut through this bitch with my hat low\nNow I ride through this bitch in the Batmobile\nSee somethin' that's ill, come flow through the 'Ville\nAin't too hard to tell who behind the wheel\n\nYou rent somewhere, but I can live somewhere\nAt least somewhere that's not like that there\nYou rent somewhere, but I can live somewhere\nAt least somewhere and that's not like that there\nRuby stones on me like a rosary\nChampagne gold, rose in pink, ring around the rosie"}
