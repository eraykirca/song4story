Did I strike a nerve?\n'Cause when I brought out the angel's head\nCouldn't help but observe\nThat your wrinkled face was turning red\nAnd why are you avoidin' war?\nThat's what the guns you sell are for\nThanks to my being respectless\nOne thing I'm startin' to suspect is\nYou know why this angel's headless\nDo you have a disclosure?\n\nThis meeting's over!"}
