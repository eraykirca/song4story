(Young as I want to know, I will never let you go)\nTell me, what's the perfect time?\nI told you I'll be waiting\nHiding from the rainfall\nSo, tell me, what's the joy of giving if you're never pleased? (Trading a baseball lover as I face the snow)\nOn my last strength against you\nBaby, tell me what you need\nYoung as I want to know\nI will never let you go\nTrading a baseball lover as I face the snow\nSo, tell me, what's the joy of giving if you're never pleased?\nOn my last strength against you\nBaby, tell me what you need"}
