This exactly what you did\nYou ruined me for everybody\nYou ruined me for everybody, woah\n\nBye-bye, good riddance for the last time (For the last time)\nSo you can try, try (Try, try, try), maybe get it right next time (Maybe get it right)\nDifferent timeline, maybe then you can be mine (Then you can be mine)\nYou ruined me for everybody\nYou ruined me for everybody, ooh\nBye-bye, good riddance for the last time (Ooh, for the last time)\nSo you can try, try (Oh), maybe get it right next time (You can get it right)\nDifferent timeline, maybe then you can be mine (Oh)\nYou ruined me for everybody\nYou ruined me for everybody"}
