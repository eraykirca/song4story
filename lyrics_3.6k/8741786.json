(Say)\nDon't tear me down again (No)\n'Cause I've been prayin' that you might\nStill love me a little\n\nWoo-ooh\nWoo-ooh\nWoo-ooh\nStill love me a little\n\nStill love me a little\nStill love me a little\n\nI hate the words that you say when you're wishin' me well\nLike I need some time to be on my own\nBut it makes me sick to think of you with somebody else\nAnd, darlin', I'll wait for you comin' home\n\nTrippin' up over words, callin'\nAnd I can't take it anymore\nYou know that I've heard it all before\n\nSo please just say somethin' different\nSay we're not finished yet\nTell me I'm weighin' on your mind\nBaby, won't ya say somethin' different? (Say)\nDon't tear me down again (No)\n'Cause I've been prayin' that you might\nStill love me a little\n\nStill love me a little\n\nStill love me a little\nStill love me a little\n\n(Woo-ooh)\nLove me a little (Woo-ooh)\n(Woo-ooh)\nStill love me a little"}
