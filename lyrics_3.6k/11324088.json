Down, down!\nUp, up! Elevator operator\n\nI wanna be like him\nI really wanna b\u0435 like him\nI wanna be with him\nForget about that\nH\u0435ads up in the sky and we keep gettin' high\nA magic down in his lever that you cannot deny\n\nA glowing light, he's shining bright\nI cannot wait to get inside, still out of sight\nWe, we wanna go\nUp and down\nWe're movin' all around\nWe're goin' up and down\nWe're movin' all around\n\nI wanna show you my world\nWhere the beat goes up and down\nLet me open the door\nElevator operator\n\nUp, up! Down, down!\nUp, up! Elevator operator (Ah)\n\nAnd I just wanna get down\nBut I'm just goin' up\nYou better listen to the sound\nMove your body like a god\nAnd we never stop\n\nGet down!\nI wanna hear you say\nTa, ta, tatata, tatatata, tata (Get down!)\nTa, ta, tatata, tatatata, tata (Get down!)\n\nI wanna show you my world\nWhere the beat goes up and down\nLet me open the door\nElevator operator\n\nUp, up! Down, down!\nUp, up! Elevator operator (Ah)\nElevator operator"}
