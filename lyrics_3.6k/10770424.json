I'm a new woman, woman\nEyes, I'm all about mind\nYou want this? I'm a new woman\n\n(Uh, mh)\nFor everything I am, I can flaunt it\nNot for what I have, they always give it to me\nAnd my energy's immaculate\nLow profile (And you're out)\nI live to sing, I don't sing to live\nI was born pure, yes\nNot a single era will be a flop in my future\nBitch, I'm Rosal\u00eda, I only know how to serve\nThe starry night, so be it\nUntil dawn, let it be so\n\nPurple into gold (Into gold)\nPain has come and gone again\nWalked through that fire\nI rediscover\n\nI go hard, it will work out for sure\nI rev up my au-au-au-au-aura\nI'm focused, nothing pressures me\nI'm a new woman, woman\nIt will work out for sure\nI rev up my au-au-au-au-aura\nI'm focused, nothing pressures me\nI'm a new woman, woman\n\nFace, eyes, body go wild\nYou want this? I'm a new woman, woman\nEyes, I'm all about mind\nYou want this? I'm a new woman\n\nGimme that, gimme that alpha, yuh\nGimme that bigger, the better, ugh\nFeeding you the bloom growin' out my sleeve\nKissed from a rose, rose, what a, what a meal\nBad luck a sucker, gotta make you tougher\nTryna say you suffer, oh, don't blame your mother\nElevate, I liberate a new frontier\nI'm a new woman"}
