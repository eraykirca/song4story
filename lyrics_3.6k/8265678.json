It's I\nI keep it rollin', this life that I chosen, got the one creep up on me\nI be posted where the sun don't shine\nAnd this the life of a shotta, I say that it's so deep\n\n(And, oh, get it on 'til we can't for YoungBoy)\n(Sendin' shots through the night)\n(Lone soul, stuntin' down, no, he ain't)\n(Say he gon' be the last one to survive)"}
