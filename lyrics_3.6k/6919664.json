(Hello!)\nNow, can you tell me where I am?\nI don't know how I got here, but I\nI think I'm startin' to understand\nI don't belong among the angels\nAnd baby, that's just fine with me (Ha!)\nThe things I did up there were high school\nBut now I'm going for my degree\n\nHey! Sorry, but you just got in my way\nI promise, honey, I can feel your pain\nAnd maybe I enjoy it just a little bit\nDoes that make me insane?\nHaven't been the same since I expired\nDoesn't mean that I plan to retire\nAnd now I have the power to bathe all of you in entertaining fire\n\nRa-da, da-da-da-da\nDa-da, da-da-da\nDa-da, da-da-da-da\nDa-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da\nDa-da, da-da-da-da\nDa-da, da-da-da\nDa-da, da-da-da-da\nDa-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da\n\nWait a minute, do I know you?\nWeren't you an old pal of mine?\nDeparted from us far too early\nBut now we're meeting a second time\nWe used to have such fun together\nAnd maybe you have what I need\nBut first, I have one tiny question\nTell me, do you demons bleed?\n\nHey! Sorry, but you just got in my way\nI promise, honey, I can feel your pain\nAnd maybe I enjoy it just a little bit\nDoes that make me insane?\nHaven't been the same since I expired\nDoesn't mean that I plan to retire\nAnd now I have the power to bathe all of you in entertaining fire\n\nRa-da, da-da-da-da\nDa-da, da-da-da\nDa-da, da-da-da-da\nDa-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Ha-ha-ha, yeah!)\nDa-da, da-da-da-da\nDa-da, da-da-da (Alright!)\nDa-da, da-da-da-da\nDa-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da\n\nHey! Sorry, but you just got in my way (Ra-da, da-da-da-da)\nI promise, honey, I can feel your pain (Da-da, da-da-da)\nAnd maybe I enjoy it just a little bit (Da-da, da-da-da-da)\nDoes that make me insane? (Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da)\nHaven't been the same since I expired (Da-da, da-da-da-da)\nDoesn't mean that I plan to retire (Da-da, da-da-da)\nAnd now I have the power to bathe all of you in entertaining fire (Da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da, hahahaha!)\n\nHey!
